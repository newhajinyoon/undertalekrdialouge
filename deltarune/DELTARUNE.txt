1* It says... "Thoust fools, thou will NEVER figure it out now!"

3* Ruining instructions... That's definitely against the rules!

1* Then it, um, says,
"PS - I make my own Rules. - RK"

* Well, that explains that.

* Why don't we just climb over this spiked fence?

* Umm, because then we'd get impaled and die...?

* Cool, I'll work on that and you do the puzzle.

8* Ummm, Susie...?

8* Not to downplay your contributions, but...

1* You... didn't actually help at all.

B* You only made everything WORSE by attacking it.

1* If you had just acted nice to it in the first place...

6* We could have avoided that entire battle.

* Huh?
* Are you FOR REAL?

7* That thing was BLOODTHIRSTY!!!

2* The only thing keeping it at bay was MY AX!

* And, earlier, you terrorized those troops...

* Those guys were ENEMIES. They're FOR terrorizing.

* Yeah! She's right!!

* And before that, you ate an innocent person's cake...

* Cakes... are also my enemy.

1* Susie... Whether you like it or not...

6* You're a hero.

0* One with the power to bring peace to the future.

5* Could you please start... acting like one?

* Yeah, when you lay it out like that...

* I've been a pretty bad hero, haven't I?

* ...

* Alright, Ralsei.
* You got it.
* I'll change my ways.

* From now on, I won't be such a rotten hero anymore.

* I'll just be one of the BAD GUYS instead!

* R... Really!?

3* You're going to be on MY team?

* Yeah, sounds way easier, honestly.

* Susie, you can't just -

* Quiet, Toothpaste Boy! Susie is MY comrade now!

* Hahaha, yeah, Toothpaste Boy!

* We're going to have monogrammed track jackets!

* Kris...

6* Perhaps I shouldn't have been so hard on her.

1* ...

* But, I just worry that if Susie is too eager to fight...

4* Then...

6* Well, let's just be kind to her, OK, Kris?

4* When I smash this guy into the GROUND!

* Huh!? That hardly did anything!

1* How can we push off that CROWN...?

6* Whatever can we do, Kris...?

* ... Hey.

* Sometimes persistence is key, Kris!!

6* It'll be hard, but we can do it!!

* That's fine, Susie!
* I'll help!

0* You want to apologize to it for earlier, right?

* Nah, I just need you to stay still.

* You explained to K. Round about the importance of dodging Susie's attacks.

* But it didn't seem to understand...

* You started making siren noises with your mouth and looking at Susie.

* K. Round still didn't understand...

* You started explaining that Susie is really dangerous and strong.

* Susie got a large boost to her morale.

* Susie's ATTACK went up massively...!

* A castle...?

* Why the hell is there a castle inside a supply closet...?

Welcome, heroes...!

* Who's there!?

Do not be alarmed...
I am not your enemy.

Please come forward,
both of you...

* Kris, Susie...
* Thank you for listening to my long tale.

* I deeply believe you two are the HEROES of the LEGEND.

* That despite whatever enemies you may face...

* ... You two have the COURAGE to SAVE THE WORLD.

* DELTA WARRIORS! 
* Please, won't you accept your destiny...?

* Uhhh...
* Nah.

* W... what?

* Me?
* Some kind of hero or something...?

2* You've got the wrong person.

* B-but Susie, without you, the...
* The world will...

* So what?
* If the world gets destroyed...

1* It's none of my damn business.

2* Might even be kind of fun, honestly.

* ...

* Anyway, Kris...

0* If YOU wanna play pretend with this weirdo...

1* Stick around.

2* I'M going to find a way out of here.

* Susie...
* Wait!

* Ho ho ho!

0* The heroes are already running away...

1* And they didn't even know I was here.

3* My dad's gonna make me Son of the Month!

* Who the hell are you!?

* I'm...!

* Ho ho ho!
* One nerd down, two to go!

3* My dad's gonna make me Son of the Month!

* Who the hell are you!?

* I'm...!

* The bad guy.

0* You CLOWNS want to seal our DARK FOUNTAIN, huh!?

2* And - STILL picturing you guys as CLOWNS -

0* Save the world from ETERNAL DARKNESS, huh!?

0* Eh.

* Don't try to deny it...!

0* We both know you'll go EAST!

* It's your only way home!

2* But, I, LANCER, won't let you go there!

0* And I've got a flawless two step plan to ensure it.

2* Step one.
* I thrash you.

1* Step two.
* You lose!

1* Hmm. Nice plan, kid.

6* R-really...?

2* Yeah, actually...

3* Mind if we use it on you instead?

* The bad guy.

0* "Bad guy?"

6* You know.
* Teardrop-headed kid.
* From the legend?

1* ... No?

4* Aw boy.
* This is gonna be hard to explain.

* Umm...
* I could help explain it...!

0* Stay out of this, kindboy!

0* No!
* I'll protect the heroes with my life!

0* Actually, can you hold off?
* I wanna hear this kid.

6* OK, so, long story short.
* You guys are heroes.

* You wanna go EAST, and seal our DARK FOUNTAIN.

6* That'll stop darkness from covering the world.

* We, on the other hand, don't want that, because:

1* It would rule, and be great.

2* Wait, why DO we want to stop that?

7* Uhh, I dunno...
* I guess I could go ask my dad?

* I could tell you!

* We GOT this.

1* So the POINT is, you wanna fight us?

1* Correct-a-mundo!

2* Arright, kid...

3* NOW you're telling me something I understand.

* Are you two OK...?

* Um, allow me to introduce myself more properly, I am...

* Jeez, can you take off that hood?

* I can barely hear you under there.

* U-ummm, alright...

* Hello everyone.
* I'm Ralsei.

0* Kris, Susie...
* It's ever so wonderful to meet you!

8* I'm certain we're going to become great friends, and,

0* Best way to leave is East, right?

0* Yes!
* That's where we'll...

0* Got it.

* See ya at school, Kris.

* Umm...

6* I suppose it's just the two of us, then...

5* Kris, I'm a PRINCE, but...

6* I, um, currently don't have any subjects.

5* I've been waiting alone here...

6* Um... My whole life for you two to arrive.

0* So...
* I'm really happy to meet you.

8* I hope we can be good friends, Kris.

* Let's try to find Susie.
* She must be to the southeast.

* You can lead the way, Kris!

0* See that HEART, Kris?

* That's your SOUL, the culmination of your being!

B* Within, it holds your WILL... your COMPASSION...

B* If it gets hit, you and your friends will lose HP.

3* If everyone's HP reaches 0, we'll lose the battle.

0* So, please take care to avoid the enemy's attack.

8* Ready?
* Let's try dodging!

0* That's DEFENDING, Kris.
* You'll recover TP and take less damage.

8* You should learn to ATTACK first, though.

8* Gee, Kris!
* You sure are good at defending!

6* I'm not attacking, you, though, so...
* No need to defend!

1* Ummm...
* Kris?

8* There are no bullets, and you can't use TP...

8* So, umm, maybe you could stop defending?

9* ...

8* Great job, Kris!
* Now that you've gathered TP -

0* How about spending that TP on one of my SPELLs?

* Because you hit the enemy enough, it got TIRED.

* Now, if I use my PACIFY spell on it...

8* It'll fall asleep, and we'll win peacefully!

1* If you had, um, hit the enemy, it'd be TIRED now.

0* In that case, we use my PACIFY spell on it...

0* Oh, Kris, you found an ITEM?

1* I figured ITEMs are self-explanatory, so...

6* Let's skip over them for now, OK?

3* You really want to learn about ITEMS, Kris...?

0* OK, I'll teach you!

1* Errm...

0* You use them, and something happens.

8* ... is that sufficient?

6* Yes, haha, that ITEM is very pretty, isn't it?

8* I'm glad you're enjoying yourself, Kris...!

8* Kris, we can find lots more ITEMs on our journey!

0* Which, will continue... after this tutorial.

8* Kris, please ask me to do a spell.

8* Kris, wouldn't you rather learn about SPELLs?

6* Kris, do you... know what a SPELL is?

1* Can humans not even ASK people to use them...?

6* Kris, what if you just give me a hand sign?

*8 Ummm, if this is too difficult...

* Let's move to the next lesson, OK?

* [IMG]3   ing! Through this, even the most violent enemies...

8* Can be defeated through various [IMG]3   s of kindness!

* Kris, though it's just a dummy, why not give it a HUG?

B* Remember when you HUGGED the dummy by [IMG]3   ing on it?

0* Because of that, its name turned YELLOW!

* Now by using the SPARE 
  ([IMG]4   ) command, you can win!

0* Great, Kris! A healing spell works too!

* Now I have just a little more to teach you!

* [IMG]3   ing! Through this, even the most violent enemies...

8* Can be defeated through various [IMG]3   s of kindness!

6* Kris, though it's just a dummy, why not give it a HUG?

0* Great, Kris! We would have won the battle by now!

0* Great, Kris! If it was TIRED we would have won!

0* Remember when you HUGGED the dummy by [IMG]3   ing on it?

* Because of that, its name turned YELLOW!

* Now by using the SPARE 
  ([IMG]4   ) command, you can win!

8* Ah, Kris, don't worry about that command yet!

6* You're really merciful, aren't you, Kris?

1* Kris, you are aware it's just a dummy, right...?

0* Kris, since you SPARED an enemy after ACTING,

1* You would have won in a real battle, but, um...

0* Don't you want to learn other things, first?

0* I see... Then, perhaps we can just end here.

1* You know how to win peacefully, so...

8* That's good enough for me!

0* Great job, Kris!
* That'd be the end in a real battle!

8* I'm really happy I had the chance to teach you, Kris!

3* W-wow, Kris!
* That was an amazing attack!

8* Have you done this before or something...?

0* Good job, Kris!
* By the way, you'll do more damage...

8* Pressing 

 when the cursor enters the box on the left!

3* Kris!
* You did it!!!

8* (I was really just about at my limit...)

0* OK, next let's try DEFENDING. ([IMG]1    )

* Simply ([IMG]1   ), and the enemy's attack will hurt you less...

* Not only that, but you'll also gather TP!

* (Watch the orange big bar on the left! I'll explain it next!)

0* Kris, if you didn't notice, when you DEFENDED before -

* The big orange TP bar on the left filled up a bit!

* How about spending that TP on one of my SPELLs?

* Because you hit the enemy enough, it got TIRED.

* Now, if I use my PACIFY spell on it...

* It'll fall asleep, and we'll win peacefully!

1* Ummm... Kris?
* You don't need to hit it anymore.

8* I already know you're great at attacking!

1* U-umm, Kris... H-How do I put this...?

1* Kris, seeing you, um, attack an effigy of myself...

6* ... Kris, are you trying to say something?

6* Ah, Kris... I... um, I think I understand.

1* W-well, if... during our adventure,

7* ... if you want to hit me, that's OK, too!

3* Oh, sorry, Kris!
* I forgot to mention!
* When you're ATTACKing...

8* Press 

 again when the cursor goes in the box!

8* It's OK, Kris!
* You'll get it!
* Try again!

8* Press 

 when the white rectangle's in the blue box!

6* Ummm... you can press 

 a lot, if it helps!

6* Kris...
* Please try to press 

.

6* Ummm, Kris?
* Can you see the white rectangle?

8* You know rectangles?
* They're like messed-up squares?

9* ...

6* Umm, perhaps we should try something else?

6* Umm, perhaps we should try something else?

0* Kris, if you didn't notice, when you DEFENDED before -

* Huh...? Kris, you'd rather hug it out than fight?

1* ...

8* You know what, that's fine! We don't need to fight!

* OK, next let's try DEFENDING. ([IMG]1    )

* Simply ([IMG]1   ), and the enemy's attack will hurt you less...

* Not only that, but you'll also gather TP!

* (Watch the orange big bar on the left! I'll explain it next!

* Kris, if you didn't notice, when you DEFENDED before -

* The big orange TP bar on the left filled up a bit!

* How about spending that TP on one of my SPELLs?

* Because you hit the enemy enough, it got TIRED.

* Now, if I use my PACIFY spell on it...

* It'll fall asleep, and we'll win peacefully!

* Aww, that's great, Kris!

0* Each enemy has different ACTs that satisfy them.

* When an enemy is satisfied, its name turns YELLOW.

* When that happens, you can defeat it by SPARING ([IMG]4    ) it!

once again?

Begone!
We have found
fresh
purpose.

For the
KNIGHT
has appeared.

The KNIGHT
that pulls
the Fountains
from the
Earth.

Holy
Fountains,
whose shadows
are creating
a new
world...

OUR world.

Hahaha...
Do you see
now our NEW
purpose...?

Soon, this
world
shall be
blanketed
in darkness...

And DARKNERS
shall RULE
it!

Then, you may
see what it is
like to live
in DESPAIR!

Now, enough
talk!

Fall before
the chain of
justice!

... ha,
you're
quite strong,
aren't you!?

If I keep
fighting you
like this,
then...

It seems...
that...

My KNIGHT...
I shall not
fail you...

* Darkness pours from the fountain.

* KING's mouths gave a berserk smile.

* The battlefield is rumbling.

* KING's mouths babble indecipherably.

* KING's cape flutters weakly.

* KING - Abandoned by the Lightners, his heart became cracked with hatred.

* He cannot be reasoned with, but don't give up...!

* You tried to reason with the King...

* Silence, Lightbringer!

* Your very existence goes against our own...

0* By the Knight's will, I shall shatter your heart to pieces!

* Your will is changing...
* TALK became COURAGE!

Courage

Defense
Boost

* You encouraged the party!
* The party's DEFENSE raised for this turn!

* Susie tried to reason with the King...

* Arright, listen up.

2* Lancer's my friend.

C* So if we can get by without hurting you, then...

* If I perish, so be it!

4* Show my son the monster you REALLY are!

* ...

3* Arright, you wanna see what I can do, huh?

* Susie's will is changing...
* TALK became RED BUSTER!

RedBuster

Red
Damage

* Your SOUL shined its power on Susie!

* Ralsei tried to reason with the King...

* You might not realize it, but...

6* This is a world where you don't have to fight.

8* I know if we try, we can all find another way...

6* Such simple-minded platitudes...

0* A shame you will not live to realize your naivety.

4* Now, perish with the pathetic LIGHTNERs you worship!

* Sorry, my friends and I aren't going anywhere!

* Ralsei's will is changing...
* TALK became DUAL HEAL!

DualHeal

Heals
everyone

* Have you dispatched the Lightners, as I commanded?

* N... No, b-but...

3* I did even better!

2* It turns out we don't actually have to fight them!

3* They said they could just talk to you, and...

* They're ALIVE?

* Yes, and I think you'll like them a lot!

2* There's Susie, she's very purple and strong, and...

* D... Don't... get too attached?

* You have failed.

* They have poisoned you with their sentimentality.

* Free yourself, Lancer.

* N... no they aren't...

* WHAT DID YOU SAY!?

* Let him go.

* Ha ha ha ha...

* Then how about this...?

* I'll drop him off the edge and let him splatter...

* Unless you all KNEEL and learn your place!

* What will it be, Lightners!?

* D-don't listen to him Susie, he'll... he'll...

* Now WATCH, Lancer...!

* SEE what happens when you befriend Lightners!

* Wh... What the!?

* YOU... YOU TRAITOR...!
* COME BACK HERE...!

* Alright, enough already.

* Who the hell do you think you are?

* You are much stronger... than I envisioned...

* Enough... is enough...

* I see... I see that I cannot defeat you.

* I have grown exhausted from our long battle.

* Lightners... I...

3* Perhaps I... I have been too cruel.

1* The truth is... I was not always this way.

3* There once was a time...

* ... where Darkners and Lightners lived in harmony.

* A time where Darkners could fulfill their purpose in peace...

2* It would be a lie to say that I, too...

3* ... do not yearn for those days.

* ... Perhaps... Perhaps you young ones are right.

2* Please... let us put away our weapons.

* There must be a peaceful solution to all this.

* ...

* (Come now, Susie!)

* I'm glad you're starting to realize, Mr. King...

6* None of us really want to fight.

0* If you can just tell us about your worries...

8* I'm sure we can all be friends, Mr. King!

* Y-yes... "Friends..."

* That sounds... lovely...

* (C... cough)
* My apologies, I am...

3* I am not used to... fighting like that...

* My body is... getting weak...

* Oh, don't say another word!

* There, you should be all healed up!

6* How do you feel...?

* L... Let's see...

* Never better.

* Y... You...

* Oh, spare me the heroics.

* From my.

* Heh heh heh heh...

4* OR WHAT?

0* Surely you must realize...

5* How exhausted I am, Lightner.

* Any hit from you would kill me.

0* Why not do it, Lightner?

5* Kill me and show my son how much you REALLY care.

* OR WHAT?

4* You'll KILL me?

* Nah.

* So what's your plan, then...?

* To TALK me to death...?

* So what's your plan, then...?

* To TALK me to death...?

* You stupid, stupid Lightner.

* You honestly think you have any way...

* You stupid, stupid Lightner.

* H... Huh?

* Why am I suddenly... so sleepy...?

* Hey Kris, y'alright?

* Th... That was close, Susie!

6* I'm surprised you remembered my Pacify spell...

* Hey, c'mon.

9* I'd never forget something I made fun of you for.

* Kris, Susie... I'm... I'm sorry.

* Because I healed the KING, we almost... we almost...

6* Susie, you were right. I...

4* I was foolish to think we could act so soft to everyone...

4* This isn't a world where kindness always wins, is it?

1* Eh, it's complicated.

0* Yeah, sometimes there's people you just gotta fight.

1* But if you NEVER let your guard down, then...

* You might just... hurt someone you care about, too.

* Everyone!!!
* You're OK!!!

* Lancer! Hey!!!

3* Sorry, I kinda beat up your dad.

* That's OK! It happens!

3* Oh, it even looks like he's having a beauty nap!

1* That's good.
* He seemed cranky.

* Man, you can say that again!

* Err, Lancer...?
* What's that noise...?

* Oh. I actually... came to WARN you clownlings.

6* I informed the Guys you were fighting My Dad, but...

7* Instead of eagerly volunteering to help you,

4* Everyone just caught the "freak-outs."

7* Now they appear to be... um...

* Breaking through the door to the throne room.

* Well, uh, that's not the best.

* Kris, Susie...

6* It seems that you must hurry to the Fountain.

* Nah.

2* But THEY might.

* L... Lancer!?
* E... Everyone!?

* WHAT is the meaning of this!?

* Sorry, Dad!
* You're being overthrown!

0* When I told everyone you were fighting the Lightners...

3* Everyone remembered how kind they were!

0* They decided they'd rather have a king...

1* That accepts them!

2* Me!!!

3* Now I'm the dad!!!

* You IDIOTS! The Lightners are your ENEMIES!

* FOOLS! I'LL KILL YOU! I'LL KILL ALL OF YOU!

0* ... what the hell is up with the bucket, though?

* It's to put the blood in.

* Oh.

* Yeah, I'm not, uh, supposed to make a mess.

3* Anyway, thanks for your feedback! I'm really feeling scary!

* ... ummm, no problem, I guess.
* Haha.

2* ... Oh!
* Yeah!

6* ... I was so excited I forgot to bring any guys.

1* But NEXT TIME, it'll be the END for--

* Hey, I've just been calling you guys CLOWNs...

0* Does your team have an OFFICIAL NAME or something?

* Oh, Kris, we should come up with a name!

* No, we shouldn't.

* Then it's decided!
* Everyone puts a name in the bucket!

Once upon a time, a LEGEND
was whispered among shadows.

It was
a LEGEND
of HOPE.

It was
a LEGEND
of DREAMS.

It was
a LEGEND
of LIGHT.

It was
a LEGEND
of DARK.

This is the legend of
     DELTA RUNE

For millenia, LIGHT and DARK
have lived in balance,

Bringing peace to the WORLD.

But if this harmony
were to shatter...

A terrible calamity would occur.

The sky will run
black with terror

And the land will
crack with fear.

Then, her heart pounding...

The EARTH will draw
her final breath.

Only then, shining with hope...

Three HEROES appear
at WORLDS' edge.

A HUMAN,

A MONSTER,

And a PRINCE
FROM THE DARK.

Only they can seal the fountains

And banish the ANGEL'S HEAVEN.

Only then will balance
be restored,

And the WORLD saved
from destruction.

Today, the FOUNTAIN OF DARKNESS-

The geyser that
gives this land form-

Stands tall at the
center of the kingdom.

But recently, another fountain
has appeared on the horizon...

And with it, the balance of
LIGHT and DARK begins to shift...

3* Susie's trying to get me to swear more.

* Stuck on this puzzle too?

* Don't talk to me while I'm scheming.

* Say, why don't you just walk over the spikes like before...?

* Heh, why bother when you guys will solve it for us?

* (Oh, I thought it was because I'm afraid of spikes.)

* SHHHH!

* Seeing you two scheme together...

8* It's a bit like a group project in school, isn't it?

* Can you stop ruining everything?

2* Beware! We split up our schemes to scheme twice as fast...!

1* I'm realizing all kinds of hidden facts about myself!

7* Such as... I don't know how to scheme very well.

* Alright, so how should we split this jelly donut?

* I'll take the blood, and you take the skin!

* If I may ask, how does a donut fit into your plan?

* All real plans allocate for delicious treats.

* Sounds like you need to go to Plan School, Dr. Toothpaste.

* Hoho! Yes! Earn a second doctorate, Smart Genius!

* (Am I being made fun of...???)

* Hey, how about we just, uh, split it in half?

6* But, uh, tell me if you see him...

* (Kris, let's just go where Susie and Lancer DON'T go...)

6* (We can figure out how to help them after we get through!)

* What are you looking at?

* Didn't he just go this way...?

* (Kris, let's NOT follow Lancer and Susie, OK?)

* Susie! Blue person whose name I neglected to learn all along!

6* I thought you were going homeways.

* We were, but Kris wanted to say bye, y'know?

* Oh!!! Really!? Hohoho!!! That's funny!!

3* I thought YOU wanted to say bye because we're friends!

* Huh!? I mean... I didn't NOT want to!

0* Umm, so, you're the king now, huh...?

* Yes!! And I'm changing some big rules!

1* First, Lightners are now legal!

2* Second, prison is now only for dads!

* Sounds like some pretty good changes.

1* Hey, your dad was, uh, protecting the fountain, right?

0* ... is it gonna be OK if we mess with it...?

* I have no idea!

2* But it's you guys, so I trust you...!

* Nah, we have to talk to Lancer first.

* DEFEND and CAST SPELLS!

* By the way, all leftover TP will turn into extra MONEY after the battle!

* Plus, getting close to bullets can sometimes end the enemy's attack faster.

* It's quite dangerous though.

* ROUXLS KAARD...
* Lord of the Puzzles...
* Be careful...!

* The KING didn't even give us severance pay...

* His son just gave us all beanies...
* Itchy beanies...

* Woah there, horsie. Ponmen're scary, but all'n they're doin' is following the King.

* Us on the Board used to have our own boss... those'n were peaceful times.

* But now, even the boss's been reduced to the King's peon...

* My name? Mr. Elegance.

* Haha, and these? These are my nostrils, not my eyes.

* ... can still see out of them, though.

* Fear not - we, unlike the simple Ponmen, possess FULL faculty over our actions.

* I, Mr. Society, am far too intelligent to ever bow down to such a tyrant!

* Unless he asks me.
* He's very scary, you see.

* What, you think you possess the power to topple that brute???

* Yes! Yes! I'm sure everyone will support you! Go for it!

* Just as long as I don't have to participate!

* Hmmm... Mr. Elegance has run off on some hellish errand...

* Huh? No, I didn't help out at all!!

* Why are or aren't you asking!?

* Hey, kid. We managed to fix up this old thingamajig for you.

* It's some kinda door... It can take you anywhere you want in the world!

* As long as that's one of two locations.

* Anyhoo, we'll keep working on it... Anything to help you out, kid!

* Hey kid, we managed to get this door to go to the castle.

* Hope it helps you out!

* ... Where'd this door come from?

* Dunno... come to think of it, I've never seen it before.

* Woah there, horsie. Me and Mr. Society got this door workin' for ya.

* It can go anywhere you want... 'long as it's one of the two destinations.

* Since it was just the two of us, it was tough work, and it might break.

* Anyhow (ha ha) hope'n it helps you deal with the King.

* Woah there, horsie. Mr. Society and the puzzle guy fixed that door.

* Since it was just the three of us, it should work without any issues.

* Anyhow (ha ha) hope'n it helps you deal with the King.

* This door'll go even further than before.

* Not sure'n what we did to make it work like that, but...

* Now, don't tell anyone Mr. Society helped... he doesn't want none of that.

* I'm watchin' ya now... with my nostrils.

* Don't mind me.
* I'm on break.

* ... Say, help me. I need to get something for my friend CLOVER'S birthday.

* Her only interests are SPORTS, CUTE BOYS, and TREES.

* ... maybe I'll just get her a card.

* Maybe I could put some money in the card... No, I need that!

* I used to WORK at the castle until the KING fired all the STAFF.

* What was my job? Oh, I was the ROYAL COAT RACK!

* Ah, that SCARF!

* I noticed that you, simply took it, without asking!

* That's fine! It's my gift to help you defeat the KING!

* You folks are really energetic! Ha ha! And potentially criminals!

* You folks look like heroes!
* Take the SCARF from this chest and DEFEAT the KING!

* Besides, it's old, ragged, and doesn't fit me anymore!

* That's what CHESTs are for! It's kind of hand-me-down situation in there!

* Hey, where's that scarf! Did it not fit you?

* That's OK! Just put it in a chest! Someone else will take it!

* I used to WORK at the castle until the KING fired all the STAFF.

* What was my job? Oh, I was the ROYAL COAT RACK!

* (...)

* (I'm just a little ball, I don't want to discuss anything.)

* Today's a special day~
* OBVIOUSLY.

* (Break the Box for a Bracelet.)

* Bow-Bow!
* (It will Boost your Befense.)

* Bow-Bow!
* (Bracelets are my Bfavorite.)

* The King wants to o-liminate Lightners, but... we didn't o-gree with that.

* We o-scaped, but the o-thers were o-rrested...

* Don't worry about talking to my o-ssociate here.
* Whenever Bow-Bow talks...

* She always goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on...

* And on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on...

* (This cardboard stand is actually just a fake cardboard stand of a cardboard stand.)

* Before the King came along, I used to eat the leaves from this tree...

* Now I still do that.

* Such is the way of the worm...

* Such is the way of the worm...

* These birds are Pissing me off...

* I'm the original   Starwalker 

* S-somehow, Prince Lancer's made REAL friends with a Lightner...

* S-somebody should tell the King, immediately...!

* ... But, it's definitely not going to be me.

* Whoever breaks the news is gonna get wrecked!

* Don't look at me!

* Ugh! I'm jealous of everyone with a leaf!

* How's the thrash machine we designed going?

* The WHAT machine?

* The machine...? We had a whole sequence about it...?

* Oh, that. Yeah, we'll make it at the last minute.

* You two should REALLY start working on it earlier...

* WHAT'S with the lecture?

2* I didn't come here for a second dad!

* Heheh, yeah, you tell him!

* Being a bad guy sure is relaxing!

* Kris, if you're jealous, you can be a bad guy, too...

* Kris isn't jealous of your evildoing lifestyle...!

6* (But um, if you are, I can find a nice leaf and fan you...)

* So, er... ready to be a good guy again, Susie?

* Nah. Gotta say being a bad guy is pretty sweet.

2* Not only is it WAY more fun than being "good,"

* But MY teammate's PROUD of what I do.

* Earlier, Susie ate a pinecone off the floor.

* It gave her a terrible stomach-ache.

3* It was VERY brave and cool.

* SEE??? Finally, some RESPECT!!!

* Hey, move it, Captain Toothpaste.

* You're blocking my reverse-tan.

* The shadow's flares are making us as pale as a horse!

* You can follow behind us, you know.

* Oh, okay!

* ... I noticed you aren't doing that.

* Yeah!

* Thanks for inviting me! This trash can's really great!

* I apologize for the inconvenience earlier!

* I'm gonna invite my friends into this trash can, too!

* (Oh, oh. I'm just the cage.)
* (No one talks to me!)

* (Are you enjoying the show?)

* (I'm Goulden Sam.)

* (It's tough being the fourth cage.)

* (Us animals used to be alone in these cages.)
* (Now everyone's here.)

* (So many new people... Wish we could go back to the good old days,)

* (When it was just us in these filthy cages.)

* (The sound of various animals tumbling around.)

* Woe! Oh, Woe!
* We are the three Former Kings!
* We beg you, free us!

* Once, all four of us ruled together, but when the Knight arrived, everything changed...

* Oh, my diamonds! My jewels! You must tell me if they're all right! Ohh!!

* What, you say? Your world is in danger?

* Well, that's a shame, isn't it.

* Since I didn't want to fight you guys, I got locked up...

* How can I!? You guys seem WAY nicer than the King...!

* Haha, I'd rather be in jail than face you guys! You're terrifying!

* I was arrested for making a puzzle without a license...

* I... I'll never make another word search! Promise!

* We sold all of our beds to replace them with treasure.

* My back hurts, but life has never been better!!!

* Huh?

* You two are real heroes, you know that?

* What about me?

* You too, Talking Beast...
* You too.

* Hey, it's you!
* You're that peaceful Lightner!

* Woah, you even tamed the beast that was tormenting us...!

* ... beast?
* What beast?

* Ohhh!!! You even taught the beast to talk!?

* Here, have a Choco Diamond!

* (You got the Choco Diamond.)

* I'm sorry, we don't have any room for that.

* That's OK, I already ate it.

* You weren't as nice as I thought...

* I guess people shouldn't have heroes.

* I... I'll never forgive you for that forgiveness...

* I feel just OK about you chumps now...

* ... Wait, what about her?
* Will she hurt us anymore?

* Nah, you're good.

2* (Unless Kris tells me to I guess.)

* (Sigh...) Rouxls Kaard was standing here...

* (Sigh...) I think making block-pushing puzzles is a totally hunky hobby...

* (Looks like Hathy sold all the gems and replaced them with beds.)

* (Looks extremely well slept.)

* (Hathy looked at you kindly. Your sins against Hathy were forgiven.)

* (Hathy looked at you...)

* We're sorry about hurting you earlier...

8* We promise we won't do it anymore!

* (Hathy felt your sincerity. Hathy forgived your sins...)

* (You felt a weight being lifted from you.)

* (Hathy looked at you kindly. You felt about the same.)

* (Hathy will never forget what you've done.)

* In a good way?

* (In a bad way.)

* Oh.

* (Sigh...) Rouxls Kaard was standing here...

* (Sigh...) Sorry I'm sighing, I didn't get much sleep.

* Oh! Let us take your coat!
* And put it in the TOILET! HA!
* ... which, we don't even have.

* Please try the baseballs~!
* Yeah! Eat so many you CHOKE!
* ... do they eat sports?

* Then we can all play Twister~!
* Just stay OUT OF OUR WAY!
* ... we lose even by ourselves.

* Were you invited?
* YOU WEREN'T!!!
* You DID hurt us...

* Awkward...
* You wanna REMATCH!?
* You'd better leave...

* I'm the first party member.
* I'm in charge of the DPS.
* (Dancin' Party Soundtrack.)

* (Hathy is the second party member. It's the healer.)

* (She was in charge of catering the party.)

* (Unfortunately the cake she commissioned was destroyed in a field somewhere.)

* (That's a risk that one always runs when ordering a cake.)

* (Show's over! Everybody go home!)

* (What's all the fuss about? Fewer people are in cages...)

* (Us animals decided it's OK if the Kings stay in the cages as well.)

* (... but they'll have to put on animal ears and noses...)

* What ho!! What about us!? Aren't we going to be restored as Kings...!?

* ... Ah? My treasure is unharmed? Carry on, then.

* I'll be honest, at first we weren't sure who make our new King...

* ... I mean, Lancer HAS always been a bit of a pain.

* But after seeing how nice he treats YOU guys, I think he'll be fine!

* I have high hopes for the new King.

* He's already mandated a 400-percent increase in salsa production.

* Mama miba!! What a celebration!! This calls for a cake!!

* And this time, I'll make it out of metal so animals can't eat it!

* Clover's mother!
* Please sample my cakes any time!

* Do I HAVE TO be Clover's mom to do that?

* Yes! That's my arbitrary rule!

* Mama miba! What a celebration! Everyone is here!

* This must be the birthday party I made that cake for!!

* Clover's birth!! Such a sweet occasion!! I might cry!

* Uh... actually, this whole thing is, like, OUR fault.

* Oh! Mon amiga!! Then... YOU'RE Clover's mother!?!??

* Now I understand why you ate the cake!! To protect her!!

* Huh, wait, no, I --

3* (Wait, if I go along with this, can I get more cake...?)

* What's going on? I slept through everything...

* (Hathy looked at you proudly...)

* (Kiss!)

* (Limit one.)

* The future looks sweet~!
* Like a pile of BEE'S PUKE.
* ... which, is honey, I think.

* A kingdom with so much hope~!
* Hope you didn't SCREW IT UP.
* ... that means thank you.

* Come to our next b-day, too~!
* We'll have one SOON!!!
* ... if that's... possible...

* I knew you could do it!

* Though I was your enemy, I was cheering for you...!

* ... That's how much I disliked my job.

* Wonderful Worke, mine Amigose!

* Ah... an interesting Historical Theorie, is it not?

4* Nonetheless, the evidence precludeth such a thing...

* ... what evidence?

* I shall giveth thou a plate of Worms for thou silence.

* Deal.

* You did it! You ousted that rotten tyrant!

* I'll happily accept a bounty of credit for my contributions...

* ... Unless the King reappears, in which case -- I did nothing!

* Darn, horsey. You've'n done us a big help.

* Now all'n of us pieces can live in peaces.

* Boy, my nostrils can't thank you enough./%

* Bgreat Bwork!

* You're O-bsolutely O-mazing!

* 'Onestly, we owe you...

* Best! You're the Best!

* Way to go, kids! Now we can go back to making the puzzles we love...

* Life's got no tutorial, so try your best!

* And, thanks to your donation, I could buy a new hat and some shaving cream.

* Got nothing left to teach you now...

* Life's got no tutorial, so try your best!

* Thank you! I can go back to being a coat hanger now!

* By the by, I asked Seam to come here, but...

* There wasn't any interest.

* (Even a little ball can say something like "thank you.")

* I love reading books.
* Especially the books upstairs.
* You should really.

* Read them!

* I love reading books.
* Especially...

* The books.

* Hey short-stuff.
* Why would YOU possibly need to talk to the mayor?

* Your allowance too low?
* Ate too much candies?
* Lost your frisbee in the wash?

* Hey, short-stuff...

* That's what the cops are for.

* What? Don't talk to you like you're a "kid?" Fine...

* If you need someone to change your diaper, go ask the Cop's.

* I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
* The mayor is busy right now.

* If you need to see her, please try causing some terrible crisis.

* I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
* Are you here to complain about your teacher?

* If you don't like her, please blame your mother for getting her hired...

* The mayor's charisma is about zero.
* No, it's negative.

* But she works hard and has a good track record, so she runs unopposed.

* Thaaaaaat's politics.
* Rarely.

* Not only does she act icy, she always keeps her office's AC on full blast.

* That chill I feel... is...
* Is this what politics feels like?

* ...

1* You're alive.

0* ...

2* Nice.

1* ...

1* I'm working.

1* This uniform's...

0* Mandatory.

* Uh, we'll take the special, and do you have any edible glitter...?

* The youngest one won't eat anything if it doesn't look like treasure...

* In a pinch, sprinkles will work, too...

* Don't be a stranger now, alright, hun?

* Hey there!
* Haven't seen you in a while, hun.

* I remember, back on Sundays, after service...

* You and your family would come in and order the special.

* 'Course, things happened, and then...

* Y'all...
* Stopped comin' together.

* But every Sunday, you and your brother'd still come in.

* He'd order you a hot chocolate...

* And you two'd sit down at that table in the corner...

* ... drawin' shapes in the window with your breath.

* ...

* You must really miss him, huh?

* ... Here, how about this?

* (You got the Hot Chocolate.)

* On the house, hun.

* ... You know, I'd give you a hot chocolate on the house...

* ... But it looks like you've got enough things already.

* Take it easy, okay, hun?

* So, for you two girls, that'll be the crepes, a cinnamon latte...

* Two bunny parfaits, and... a piece of firewood...?

* And, how would you like that firewood done?

* Dude, remember when we used to skip the first hour of class to come here?

* YOU were fine, but I almost had to repeat the year 'cause of it...

* Those crepes were MAD worth, though! Delinquency is the best condiment!

* Dude, if we didn't bring Gerson our leftovers, I bet I would have failed HARD...

* Looking at my rugged body, you must wonder what kind of secrets I hold...

* My secret is, I put all my leftover pancakes in this giant hat.

* Whew!
* I sure love PANCAKE!

* Ice Wolf does not like ice in drink.

* Ice Wolf likes ice...

* ... to BE drink!

* Ice Wolf also like ice-themed mascots.

* H-How am I supposed to get past this blue lady...!?
* I'm stuck!!

* I-I guess I should just run away...

* Police Chief Undyne is supposed to be directing traffic...

* But all she's doing is standing in the middle of the street yelling "GET OUT OF MY WAY!!!"

* She's the best, huh!?
* I feel really directed!!!

* Yo, Kris!
* You survived Susie, haha!

* I mean, I never saw her beat anyone up, but, uh, I'd be careful.

* Like, one time me, Snowy, and Jockington were playing handball,

* And she just kept creepily watching us from the corner.

* Then, when the ball rolled over to her she just, uh, froze solid...

* ... and kicked the ball as hard as she could, right into Officer Undyne's car!

* Then, Undyne came out, smiling, cracked her knuckles, and totally wiped us at handball...

* Anyway, Susie sucks, Kris, haha. 

* Yo, Kris, you look kind of annoyed.
* Everything OK?

* You can calm down now, dude! Susie's not here, haha!

* ... Huh?
* You look even more annoyed...

* HOOH!!
* You're lucky, Kris!! 

* You got to miss class with Alphys! It's not fair! Ha ha ha!

* If I skipped class, my dad'd never let me hear the end of it!!! Ha ha ha!!!

* ... That's actually not even remotely funny.

* Hey neighbor-beighbor! When's yah brother Doug gonna come by? Huh huh huh!

* My girls'd love to see him! He's a sweet little man!

* He's just got one problem...
* He doesn't like my wife's cookin'!

* What's wrong, Douglas?
* You don't like frozen cat food? Huh huh huh!

* Can't blame yah brother for leavin' town.

* He's out there, gettin' a big brain in the big school.

* Hope when he becomes a big shot, he remembers us little guys down the street.

* Eatin' oranges and gettin' our stomachs pumped.

* Oh, it's you.
* Are you here to play the piano again?

* The patients can't hear it well from here, but I personally enjoy it.

* Sometimes the police chief comes in to play the piano.

* Her playing is nice, but when she starts singing...

* We have to ask her to leave.

* Hmmm... you usually play the piano a bit more... beautifully.

* Is everything OK?
* You DO seem a little sick...

* Nothin' better than hangin' at the lake with my best bro...

* Watchin' the waves go by...

* ...

* ... true.

* ... or go mad like everyone else.

1* Long ago, the Darkners lived in harmony with the Lightners.

0* They were like Gods to us.
* Our protectors.
* Our creators.
* Those who gave us purpose...

3* Then, one day we were all locked away in this prison...
* And the Lightners never returned.

1* Embittered, the King took up arms, and aims to take revenge upon the Lightners that left us behind.

0* 'Course, even among his troops, some still distantly hope the Lightners will return...

0* Historically, this land was ruled by the Four Kings, from CARD CASTLE to the East.

1* But, recently, a strange knight appeared...
* And three of the kings were locked away.

0* The remaining king put him and his strange son into power.

1* This land hasn't seen THIS much chaos since...

2* Ha ha ha...
* Well, you don't need to know about THAT.

0* He... was a funny little man. Once, the court jester. I, the court magician.

1* A friend...? Could I consider him a friend...? Perhaps, perhaps not.

2* But he was the only one who matched me in the games we used to play.

3* One day, he met a strange someone... and since then, he began to change.

1* He started saying bizarre things that didn't completely make sense -

3* But didn't completely not make sense, either.

* Soon, he began to see the world as a game, and everyone as its participants.

* As the court mage, and his only companion, I was forced to lock him away...

2* Or, rather, lock US all away, in his own words.

1* Since that time, the strange words he's said have stuck inside my cotton...

3* And my view of this world has become darker, yet darker.

2* Reflecting on these old memories, I think, perhaps - I miss playing games with him.

3* And I wonder, if I hadn't been asked to lock him up...

2* Would I have found a little more purpose in my life...?

2* Ha ha ha ...
* So you are the "heroes" who are going to seal our Fountain?

0* Ha, good luck.
* It makes no difference to me.

3* Neither Light nor Dark hold a future for a Darkner in my condition.

1* Trouble opening the door...?

0* Ha ha ha, well, whether you can or not, it doesn't matter to me.

2* But here's a hint - walk where the stars don't shine.

3* Eh...? What are you talking about...? A prisoner with an odd manner...?

1* ... No, you couldn't possibly be talking about HIM...?

3* ... I see.
* After all the trouble I went through to lock him up, you want to release him?

0* ...

1* Hmm, now that you mention it, it could be troublesome if he was left alone...

0* Yes, perhaps it's better if you Heroes dealt with him now...?

2* After all, it's not as if whatever happens, will matter in the end.

* Perhaps a little chaos might be fun.

* Kris, Susie...
* There is a LEGEND in this land.

* A LEGEND that one day, two HEROES of LIGHT will arrive,

* And fulfill the ancient prophecy, foretold by time and space.

* Please, Heroes...
* Listen to my tale...


Listen


We know it
Already

* Very well then...

* ...

1* Umm, r-really?
* Are you sure?
* It's fairly important.

* And... um, in my opinion, it's a really nice PROPHECY!

* I think you'd quite like it!

0* Phew!
* Um, very well then...

* ... really?
* You've heard it already?

* Oh... Perhaps I shouldn't have rehearsed it so much...

* Look, dude, we didn't come here for a bedtime story.

* Just tell us how to get home.

* Ummm, the easiest way would be to seal the Eastern FOUNTAIN.

* Fountain?

1* You mean, uh, like the water bubbler or something?

* THE fountain.
* That which gives the DARK WORLD form.

1* ... umm, are you sure you actually know the legend?

* Look.

* ...

* No.

* But I think I've got enough info.

* See you two later.

* W-wait!
* Let me at least tell you how to...

I'll be
Your
Subject

Keep

* This is the CASTLE TOWN, where my subjects reside...

1* Err, well, they would if I had any...

8* Oh, don't worry about me, Kris!

0* I'm certain I'll find a subject someday...

3* H... Huh!?

7* Why, Kris, you don't have to do that...

1* ... but, if you insist...

0* Kris, as your Prince and authority, I order you to...!

8* Please let me know what to do!

* Oh, thank you, Kris!
* I will!


I know


Really!?

* Er, Kris, you know you can hold ~1 to run...?

* Really?
* And yet you choose not to...?

6* Right, who knows how long these leisurely days will last...

0* There's nothing wrong with taking your time, Kris.

* Right!
* You'll move faster by holding ~1!

8* And I'll be right behind you, so don't worry!

6* ... Unless you want to get away, in which case, sorry.


I know


Really!?

* Umm, Kris, did you know...

* ... You can skip text by pressing 

?

* ... Really?
* So you've just been...

2* Listening to me talk, because you wanted to?

6* I'll try to make it worth your while, Kris!

* Right! In the case you read very quickly.

1* Or you're tired of what's being said.

6* ... No need to skip my text, right, Kris?


Yes


Don't

3* Oh, Kris!
* It's the training dummy I made!

8* Now seems like a great chance to prepare for the enemy.

0* Would you like me to teach you how to fight?

0* OK!
* Get ready, Kris!

3* Right, you already fought Lancer, didn't you...?

1* I was so excited to teach you, I absolutely blanked!

2* ... B-but, um...
* Just in case you forgot anything...

6* Here!

* The Great Door is opened?!

* No wonder Lancer was able to come through...

1* ...

* Kris, once we pass through this door...

* Our adventure will really begin.

* A journey foretold exactly by the prophecy...

6* But, Kris, I believe YOUR choices are important, too.

0* This world is full of all kinds of people, Kris.

6* In the end, how we treat them makes all the difference.

8* So let's try our best to get by without FIGHTing.

1* If we can manage to do that...

0* I believe this tale may have a happy ending.

6* Otherwise, I fear that...

1* ... you may not... find the result favorable.

3* ... Oh, I'm sorry! Is that too much to ask?

0* Kris, I knew you were a hero the moment I saw you.

8* Let's try our best, alright?

3* O-oh, I'm sorry!

6* Kris, in the end, what you choose is up to you.

8* As long as you're happy with it, I'm happy too.

1* Jumpin' jigsaws!
* You...
* You...!

0* You're just like us.
* An' people like us gotta help each other out.

0* C'mon this way.

* Er, excuse me, Sir.
* I think I have a dollar.

0* ... is it Dark?

* Umm, yes?

* Heheh, perfect!

What's TP?

 
Secret

Gaining TP

Bye

* I'm TP Master.
* Ask me about TP's.

* Later, kid.

* TP? What's TP?
* That's what lets you cast SPELLS, see!?

* When you see that orange bar,
* Cast some SPELLS when it's filled up far.

* TP...! It's quite a caper!
* TP! Stands for...
* ... Toilet Paper!

* ... no, it stands for Tension Points.

1* What, really!?

* TP only lasts, inside a fight.
* Once you win, it's out of sight.

* Having extra, feels unbearable.
* No point in saving, it's straight-up terrible.

* But leftover TP turns into extra money at the end of battle...

1* You mean I only should have been using one square!?

* You get TP when you DEFEND.
* Protect yourself, then cast SPELLs, friend.

* You also get TP by getting close to bullets.

* Look for the heart outline when you get close to bullets.

* You rhymed "bullets" with "bullets."

1* B-because it's important!

* You rhymed "bullets" with "bullets"...?

 
Pacify

 
Healing

Fact

Bye

* I'm Ralsei Master.
* Ask me about RALSEI's.

* Later, kid.

* Ralsei's spell's called PACIFY.
* Use it on BABIES, before they CRY.

* What? It safely removes a "TIRED" enemy from combat.

1* What if you're fighting a BABY!?

* Ralsei has a spell that HEALS, dude.

* Why use that, when you can eat FOOD?

* Because you won't have to use up an ITEM?

1* I could have avoided all those empty calories!?

* Ralsei loves when you give us MONEY.

* He will hug you, and call you HONEY.

* Hey, that's not true!

8* You don't need money to get me to do that!

 
Warning

 
Attack

Fact

Bye

* I'm Susie Master.
* Ask me about SUSIE's.

* Later, kid.

* When KRIS uses WARNING, SUSIE can't hit.
* So make sure to -

* So there's no reason to use it.

1* Unless...
* Unless you wanted not to hurt -

* SO THERE'S NO REASON.

* Susie's gone, I'm afraid, I'm afreet.

*Seems like WARNING is obsolete.

* The days of WARNing, have long since past.

* The circumstances, changed pretty fast.

* Susie always attacks, the foe on top.

* She'll smash them, with a crushing chop.

* She always strikes, at the first thing she sees...

* ...

1* Oh no, oh no!
* She's looking at ME!

* Susie's gone, so no attack.

* Will you two pick up the slack?

* Susie's BUSTER, RUDE as may be...

* Will deal more damage, if you just press ~1!

* Susie loves, when you give us MONEY.
* She will -

* Nope, don't care.

1* Did I say something funny!?

* Susie's gone, so no facts.

* Will you two pick up the slackts?

* SUSIE seems to have changed, just a hair.

* That kind of growth is actually rare.

 
Reviving

 
Acting

Fact

Bye

* I'm Kris Master.
* Ask me about KRIS's.

* Later, kid.

* When HP goes negative, your friends fall down

* But bringing them back, is easy-town

* Plain foods and spells, work like a charm -

* And with a MINT, you can cure all HARM.

* Even normal items and spells can revive people, huh?

* Yeah, that's what I'm saying!

* If you only ACT, you might start to think -

* What about the guy with the scarf in pink?

* If you know ACTing will make the enemy friendly -

* Then you can ask me to SPARE on the SAME TURN.

* Or, cast PACIFY if you know they'll get TIRED.

* If you plan ahead, a lot can happen in ONE TURN!

1* Hey, who's the MASTER here, me or you!?

* It's a good idea, to give us BUCKs.

* It'll make you happy, and fill you with LUCKs.

* Over there, is our DONATION HOLE.

* We had a BOX, but it got STOLE.

 
Throw $1

 
Do not

* "Donation Hole"

* (If you like our tutorials, please throw your money into a hole.)

* (The hole is filled to the brim with cash.)

* (You put a dollar in the "Hole.")

* (The "Hole" became "Full.")

* (You don't have enough money.)

* (You failed to budget enough money to throw into a hole...)

* (You decided to save the dollar for a different hole.)

* How's the evil scheming going?

* Huh? Oh, that?

2* We, uh, got bored.
* So we're having a snack.

* ... I see.

* C'mon! All I ate for breakfast was chalk!

* And I didn't eat anything!

* Sorry. What are you two having, exactly...?

* Just a daily treasure I hid in this stump's orifice.

* And that is...?

* Feast for yourself, my main man.

* Kris, do you want to, um, try it?

6* Oh, there's a...
* Honeypot? Inside?

1* ... It's full of salsa.

3* Bingo, you sweet little pumpkin!

1* It's my secret stash.
* A little snackeroo from me to you...

* ...

8* Mmmm. Yummy. It's delicious...

* C'mon, you're just pretending to eat it!

* Haha, yeah! That's what I do, too!

* ?????

* (There was a honeypot of salsa inside the stump.)

* (You ate some salsa.)

* (It recovered... something.)

* (Not HP.)
* (Just... something.)

2* Mmm...
* Hey, what's in this?

* I don't know!

* Look, if no one else will eat it, I'll try it!

6* ... there's a jar of... Blood...?
* In here.

* No, no.
* It's merely a pot of free-range salsa.

2* Thanks, that's actually more gross somehow.

3* Any time!

2* Mmm...
* Hey, what's in this?

* I don't know!

5* Kris...?

0* Kris, honey, you have grown up so much...

9* Someday soon you will be going off to university as well...

1* ...

9* Remember when you were little...

8* You asked when your horns were going to grow in?

0* So we bought that headband with the little red horns on it.

4* Oh, you wore it for months! Whatever happened to it?

2* Kris, I need to grade these assignments.

0* Perhaps you should go to bed...?

1* You do not look very well...

 
Flowers

 
Saucer

Chalk

Nothing

* O... Oh, Kris...

4* D... Did you want to talk about something?

* Huh?

3* O-Oh, these flowers...? They're from your dad...

0* He... He always asks how you're doing in school...

7* ... Then gives me a bouquet of them.

1* ... A-actually, that he always gives me flowers...

4* ... R-really makes me w-wonder if he... If he l-likes...

B* I-if... If he l-likes...

A* ... The awesome comics I lent to him.

B* Honestly, HE kind of reminds me of a superhero, Kris.

A* (He's huge and could kick my ass.)

0* Oh, this saucer of milk?

7* I-It's for my kitty, MewMew! She's a perfect angel!

3* ... uh? What does she look like...?

9* W... well, I've never actually s-seen her, b-but...

7* Ever since I started putting out milk, it's been disappearing.

6* S... So I'd like to think that there's a cat.

9* M... My cat.

0* K... Kris, even though you never got the chalk...

0* You deserve an award for trying so hard to find it.

3* So, in return, I can let you borrow, um...

0* M... My home-made DVD collection of the Symptons!

7* Y-you know, the sitcom about the middle-class monster family.

3* It's got every episode in all 28 seasons!

0* It's the funniest, most quotable show ever...!

3* But make sure you don't watch past the second season 

9* Since they just rebooted it as Symptons Turbo 

8* They all started driving their own motor-vehicles 

3* And fighting giant giga-demons and stuff 

9* The main problem about that is that it kind of 

6* Lost the focus on family that it had earlier 

7* When their vehicles were shaped like animals 

5* And they were friends with the animal vehicles too 

3* And let's not get into Symptons Galaxy Force 

8* Where the Symptons discover another Earth 

9* On the other side of the Sun 

6* WOULDN'T THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD JUST 

1* ... Huh?

2* ... You don't want to watch it?

B* ... Th-That's ok, Kris...

1* OK, umm, if you ever need help with homework...

A* My office hours are in this disgusting alley.

0* Oh, hi, Kris!

4* I know you were having trouble last time, so, um,

0* I actually got a few things ready for you, in case --

2* Ah, wait, sorry! I can't right now...

3* I forgot my house key again, and...

4* Sorry, Kris, I'll help you later, if that's ok.

0* See you at school, Kris!

1* ...

5* ...

4* Susie! That's right, you were with Susie!

3* When you didn't come back to class, I was worried, but...

4* Everything turned out OK! I think?

5* ...

3* ... Umm, Kris? Can I ask something, if that's OK?

4* Susie... I'm kind of... curious what she's like, you know?

8* I mean, who DOESN'T wonder about her? She never talks to anyone.

4* So, Kris, could you tell me about her? If that's ok...

2* Oh, can I ask something else about her!?

3* Well, did it seem like, she, um...

8* (W-wait, you definitely wouldn't know THAT...)

2* ... huh? Why don't I ask my mom for the key?

3* I... I mean, um... I... you know,

4* She doesn't like it when I bother her when she's working.

0* Don't worry, OK? I'll just go over to Catti's.

1* Umm... Kris...? Are you feeling alright?

5* Normally you're not so... talkative.

4* Oh! I don't mean to sound like something's wrong with you.

4* ...

2* Umm, Kris, is something wrong?

3* Why did you go to the hospital to see my dad...?

2* I mean, I'm sure he appreciated it, but... um...

4* Gosh, I'm sorry, Kris. Forget I said anything!

0* Tell Azzy I said hi, Kris!

2* What...?
* She's... a nice person?

* Really!? L-like, really!? Honestly!? Truly!?

4* I mean, that's just what I was hoping, but...

2* W-wait, this isn't another trick, is it, Kris?

8* Like when you put ketchup on your arms and told me it was blood?

2* ... R-really? You're serious? You're totally serious?

6* ... gosh, then maybe I should try talking to her...

8* B-but if I die, you're paying for my funeral, Kris!

6* (Though, honestly, if she's nice I might die, too...)

2* She WHAT? She smashed you against the LOCKERS?

7* Gosh, Kris, I'm really sorry. That's just awful.

3* I... I'd THOUGHT Susie was good, just...

6* Maybe it would take someone special to find her good side.

7* ... but she really IS terrible, isn't she...?

7* Kris... I'm SO sorry you have to go through this.

4* In fact, I wonder if... d-do you think...?

3* I wonder if Alphys would let us switch partners, I mean?

2* You know, so you wouldn't have to be the one, who, um,

3* Gets to be, slammed into lockers, and stuff, anymore.

8* (Wait, I don't think I phrased that correctly...)

2* What?
* She was EATING the chalk???

* R... really...?

8* Wait! You're teasing me, aren't you, Kris?

3* L-like when you told me ICE-E was real and eats kids...

8* So Dess smacked you with a wiffle bat 'til you stopped lying.

2* ... Huh? You're telling the truth? Seriously?

5* ...

0* Umm, then... what color chalk does she like?

4* And, do you think she likes the thin or the thick kind...?

8* (Wait, maybe making her a lunchbox full of chalk is stupid...)

2* Seriously, Kris? But I help you ALL the time!

8* The LEAST you can do is give me a LITTLE information!

2* Like, d-does she like metal music!?

2* Is she really an obligate carnivore!?

2* D... Does she really have a tail underneath her jacket!?

3* Or, or... or...

Z* Lancer!? Lancer, hey...!!

C* ... so can we help him!?

A* Yes. There is a way.

B* As long as it stays flowing, any Darkner can live there.

2* So... if we bring Lancer back to school, he'll be OK again.

2* Right.

C* ... alright.

A* Lancer, we'll be back for you, buddy...

I* Your friend... If we defeat Queen, we can save him?

0* Uh, yeah.

G* ... is going to force Noelle to do her bidding.

9* And if Noelle doesn't want to...

8* ... She might make her face into a robot one.

I* But if you can help me... I have a plan.

K* A plan?

0* I remember from Queen's tour of this place...

0* There's a secret shortcut on the third floor.

1* While Kris is distracting Queen,

0* Susie will take the shortcut to reach Noelle,

0* And transfer her to me on the roof.

1* From there, I'll bring her to a safe hiding spot...

I* And together, we can all defeat Queen!

0* ...

K* Alright, sure. We'll give it a shot.

6* Haha! Most excellent!! Then...

Q* I was so nervous about first impressions.

1* I even hid my face so you wouldn't see...

Q* "How do I even be a friend...?"

J* All I have to do is be nice... is what I thought.

B* But I'm starting to realize, being friends...

2* Is more than that, isn't it?

J* Susie... sometimes she isn't nice at all!

1* But...

2* Isn't it wonderful that she's... her?

I* Is what I... started thinking, today.

* We have to ask her to leave.

* Hmmm... you usually play the piano a bit more... beautifully.

* Don't be afraid to dream!

* Ha ha! That's right! They took so long on their turn...

* What!? A horned girl? I never got to see her!

* This guy always seems like he's enjoying life more than me.

* Maybe it's because he's a higher level...?

* Is this guy seriously sucking up to you already? Even though you hurt us?

* Thank you, thank you for the wonderful home! I will NOT use it!

* Thanks a lot for the lovely city.

* It's nearly as good as the one I made in Minecrap.

* I need to mine ten-hundred blocks of Bubsidian to make my dog 3 colors.

* ... I like being like this.

* Don't tell anybody.

* These animals are stray...?

* No, they are practicing a special loneliness style.

* ... Just like me.

* Lone wolves have to stick together.

* Train at the party dojo? Ha...

* We will make our own dojo... for introverts.

* (Unless you can beat it in a fight.)

* Finally a dojo for people that are normal-shaped

* I will train my self for the tournament

* My power level is falling behind the others

* All I can do now is gasp and comment on the battle

* Looks like you got past Nubert's forcefield.

* Nubert doesn't know how that forcefield got there.

* But it's Nubert's forcefield.

* As a prize, have Nubert's treasure.

* Nubert doesn't know what's inside.

* But Nubert will give it to you.

* That's Nubert's treasure.

* Remember. You're just borrowing it.

* Forever.

* All my friends turned into Werewires, but it's no big deal.

* I've been on Queen's side since the beginning, so I'm safe!

* Complain about Queen, but she gets a lot done!

* Heh, good luck figuring out which ride to take!

* This right ride is the right one.

* I love reading books.

* Especially the books upstairs.

* I love reading.

* Especially books.

* Thank you for your help.

* I had gone up there to do 
  a little house cleaning and got stuck.

* ...

* It's terrible... The butlers are all trapped in the cafe...

* Queen is nowhere to be found, and...

* With no one to defend it, a strange force has taken over the mansion!

* Welcome to the 2F Dinner Party Section A.

* Please help yourself to anybody's food.

* Normally I'm terrified of mice, but it's OK because that one is wearing a wig.

* I am Mousemillian. I stand leagues and inches above all the other mice.

* Only Nubert remains above me still...

* Only Nubert remains above me still...

* Psst... Hey, it's me, the Hacker. No one figured it out but it's me.

* Keep it on the download.

* Psst... I'm the Hacker. Nobody figured it out yet but it's me.

* There's an east treasure's hallway leading to BASEMENT on 1F...

* Come down there and I'll help you crack the code.

* This guy keeps telling everyone at the party he's a hacker.

* I don't know what to do with this information.

* There's supposed to be another guest here, but they're late.

* They called and said something about blue checkmarks...

* This downstairs table will be for our special guests.

* There's a dinner party on the 2nd floor for everyone else.

* Combined, we have enough seats for everyone in the world.

* Everything here is tailored for you... right?

* Ralsei, good luck.

* Although you only joined us for minutes, we'll miss you.

* (He seems to be well-taken care of.)

* When are they gonna be done in there?

* (The statue of Berdly is wedged in the toilet.)

* (You glanced back at the bathroom door sign.)

* (The sign has a silhouette of a Berdly statue.)

* (Everything checks out.)

* (No problem here.)

* This is today's dinner entertainment.

* I've heard it's called "The Birth of a Fountain."

* What an elegant name.

* How elegantly quixotic!

* The QUEEN has been very interested in this video recently.

* Where the KNIGHT creates the Fountain by its own hand...

* Well, it's that and Cyber City's Funniest Home Videos.

* We are often forced to star in those videos.

* The KNIGHT created the FOUNTAIN, and this WORLD.

* It might be even more powerful than Queen.

* ... for now.

* ... for now.

* I came to support the rebels, but they aren't here.

* ... Not really sure how I would support them, though.

* I don't really want to eat bagels.

* (It's a box.)

* Don't look sad. You're never alone.

* You got Nubert.

* I'm Nubert. Everybody loves me.

* That's why I live in the trash.

* Nuelle, eh? Not a bad name, says Nubert.

* ... e-everyone else has been...

* S-save us, she's going to...

* I was running from Queen's control plugs, and got stuck up here.

* I'm... I'm too scared to go down the slide.

* ... But you know what? Talking to you has increased my confidence!

* I now have less social anxiety.

* But, I'm afraid of slides.

* You came back from pretty far just to talk to me.

* That's really increasing my confidence.

* I bet I could be a hit at parties... the slide? That's not happening.

* Now that I think about it, I don't think I could go to parties.

* Someone might put on a slideshow...

* Recently, something called "Internet" is having an "outage".

* Some say it was the secret to Queen's know-how.

* Since then, it seems like she's become quite extreme...

* I'm really only interested in cute digital cats.

* I don't think the "Internet" has anything to do with that!

* I like cats the best, but I heard "Poppup" is cute, too.

* What? It's considered a household pest? No way...

* Next you are gonna tell me that mice are vermin!

* Lightners! I haven't seen many of you recently.

* If you didn't know, an evil ruler is taking over this world.

* I don't really like politics, so I have no opinion on this.

* If you try to talk to me about politics,

* We will have no choice but to cross swords...

* Did Queen take over the world yet? I wouldn't know...

* I'm not asking you to tell me. Actually, if you do,

* We will have no choice but to cross swords....

* I heard there's a rebel team resisting Queen...

* So far all I found are overpriced bagels...

* Bagels, doughnuts ...

* Why is it round dough is always so overpriced?

2  *The hole is expensive!

* I want to go back to the city, but the way is blocked...

* I'm no country boy! Let me out of Cyber Field!

* Cuisine is so unrefined out here in the (memory) sticks.

* The way to the city is now open.

* I think I'll stay in the countryside a bit longer though.

* Everything is so naturally green here.

* I'm charmed by the local music and flavors.

* I really got used to the countryside.

* Perhaps I'm just a farmboy at heart...

* Plus, I haven't seen a single Poppup yet.

* I heard this unassuming store is the rebel base...

* But, I realized I don't really know how I would help them...

* I don't really want to buy any more bagels...

* Did you enjoy your room?

* There was a mint under your electric cage...

* Don't make a mistake, this is not a hotel.

* Spamton? This used to be his room...

* Though it's not like he used it, after a while.

* Eventually, he just spent all his time in the basement... praying.

* When things went downhill, he became obsessed with that artifact.

* Maybe he thought it would give him another big break?

* This mansion used to be a luxurious home for upper class citizens.

* Your room? It belonged to a prestigious big shot...

* Sadly, his name has been erased from the records...

* The day he was to be evicted from the Queen's mansion,

* I went to his room to check on him...

* But he wasn't there.

* There was only a phone hanging off the handle.

* He must've left in the middle of a conversation,

* Because I could still hear someone on the other end...

* ...

* But when I put the receiver to my ear...

* There was nothing but garbage noise.

* Even so, he only got more and more successful.

* He moved into a luxurious room in the Queen's mansion...

* He started bragging about big TV deals, big cars, big commercials...

* But then things started to crack.

* It seems like whatever was helping him...

* Disappeared.

* His sales dropped to zero...

* And everything came crashing down.

* Suddenly, he got really good at his job.

* The clicks started piling up...

* What? What did he do?

* Why did HE deserve this?

* We were all so jealous of him,

* We stopped going out with him.

* I mean, wasn't he a big shot?

* He didn't need us anymore, did he...?

* He started to get a little desperate.

* I heard he started looking for any way to become more popular.

* Somehow, he made the right phone call, and found someone.

* Or, was he... found BY someone?

* They must have been helping him, because suddenly,

* He was on the phone all the time...

* Night after night, when we all went to the same cyber grill,

* He'd shoot his mouth about making it big someday.

* "You just watch!"

* "Someday,

* I'm gonna be a big shot!"

* He was... Like the rest of us.

* Just... a little unlucky.

* For some reason, his products never seemed to hit...

* ... and the Lightners never even looked his way.

* ... Poor guy.

5* I wonder what we did wrong... The forcefield is still up.

* I'm retiring from hacking the main frame.

* I decided to use my powers for the good of society.

* I'm going to reverse engineer the code to Super SMashing Fighters.

* So I can put my favorite cartoon characters into the game.

* Hacking is hard work. Whoof. I need to drink a jpeg of water.

* (He's using the app that lets you drink water from your phone.)

* I saw you stand up to Queen! That was amazing!

* I'll definitely become a Werewire if you can just free me!

* I was fishing for lost pottery in the acid when I found this photo.

* Please take a look.

1* U-umm, it sure is a nice photo...

2* Susie, do you want it for your room?

H* The hell would I want this for!?

2* Kris, you look nice in this one!

Y* Hahaha!! That's awesome, Kris!

* Please do not race the pottery.

* Yes, we see you. You are the master of balance.

* Use this room as our humble yet colorful gift-shop-slash-cafe.

* Please, shop to your heart's content. We are eager to serve your any wish.

* Does a woman of Our Lady Grace's caliber not deserve -

* A coven of powerful men and women to dote upon her every movement?

* To have rap anthems written to her kindness --

* Which are then bitcrushed beyond recognition to make them more 'computer'?

* To have melons, smashed, with karate chops, repeatedly, for no apparent reason?

* To have barrels, thrown, from the rafters --

* And make us smash them all with karate chops before the timer runs out?

* But the barrels, are full of melons, and we have to smash those too?

* Yes. The answer is... yes.

* Rouxls? I am afraid I am not familiar with a guest of that moniker...

* Ah, wait. Are you perchance referring to that unbearable -

* Err, UNIQUE Man who barged in here and demanded to be made "Butler Supremeth?"

* I am afraid that person... is now banned from this establishment.

* And may have suffered injuries as a result of his, err... rather swift ejection.

* Please do not mention him again.

* We are still cleaning up the worms he left on the floor.

* Oh, you defeated that simpleton? Wonderful, wonderful.

* After he stole our flower display for one of his "boo-kettes,"

* Tasque Manager told me she saw him in the hallway,

* Where, opening with "Ah, thou muste be 50% Likelye to be Queene",

* He thrust the vase upon her, and asked to be her "minion for life."

* ... he was promptly electrocuted to the ground.

* Well. Enough of the unpleasantries. Would you like a toasted marshmallow?

* What? Basement? There's no basement here.

* You need to relax. Have a drink, and talk softly...

* You're bothering the other customers.

* ... So that's what happened.

* ...

* That robot was the embodiment of a Lightner's dream.

* A dream I helped create... once.

* Splashing color from the motion of their hand.

* The Lightner filled it with their own hope, giving it an incredible power.

* ... but, in the end, nothing ever came of it.

* And it was left in the basement with the rest of the corrupted data.

* ... But that crooked salesman! Somehow, he learned about the robot,

* And thought he could use its power to fulfill his own twisted dreams.

* What a pity. To think he was once a valued customer...

* Ah, my outfit. Yes, the monochrome look is quite suitable, isn't it?

* Black suit, colored glasses. Many people have failed to imitate this look.

* Some even going so far as to attempt to impersonate me...

1* Hmm... So we are now in the Castle Town.

0* Well, now. It makes no difference to me.

2* As long as I stay in my shop, these walls won't change.

0* ... But.

2* In a way, I suppose it's just a little bit amusing to see you again.

0* I'm sure you three will have an interesting journey.

1* Me? I'll just be here offering the same old junk.

0* As you find stronger treasure, I'm sure you'll have little reason to return here.

2* But if you have some time, I'll offer you a biscuit and a hint!

1* So we are here now, in a new world.

2* And right off the heels of defeating that clown... Incredible.

1* Ah, yes, that's right. It didn't occur to me until just now, but...

2* You three defeated that clown last time, didn't you?

* If you can defeat more strong adversaries, you may find more Shadow Crystals.

2* Try your best! It may be tough, but I'm sure it will be worth it!

0* The little prince has something to show you in his castle.

3* Well now, are you going to turn down a royal invitation?

0* If I were you, I would head home to the LIGHT WORLD.

1* Of course, I'm not you. So, I'm staying right here.

1* By the by, I can't offer any advice when you're not here...

2* So I'm not sure my hints will be much use after all! Ha ha!

1* ... Oh? What's that? It seems like he gave something to you.

0* That's right... You must not have noticed it.

3* That Crystal... It's nearly invisible, but you've been holding it this whole time.

0* Here, I'll take it off your hands and appraise it.

3* ...

1* Incredible! To think he had a Shadow Crystal...

0* Shadow Crystals, so called because you can only see their shadow.

0* ...

3* Call it a premonition, but I get the feeling you may find more of these...

2* ... If you continue to defeat strong adversaries like him, that is.

0* If you can gather more Shadow Crystals, bring them here!

2* I'm sure I can stitch together something incredible for you...

1* ... It seems that you didn't get another Shadow Crystal.

0* Hm. I understand. It's no small feat to fight an opponent that has one.

3* ...

1* Well then, forget it all.

0* You're a Lightner. Don't take your life, well, lightly!

2* Well, what have we here! You managed to find another Shadow Crystal...

1* Oh, is that so? That salesman had found the crystal in the old machine...?

0* I wonder... if perhaps, long ago, that old machine was very important to someone.

3* A certain Lightner, perhaps... or maybe it's just a hunch. Haha!

0* At any rate, it's truly unfortunate a Darkner decided to steal that power...

0* Or, is it fortunate? Because of that, you found a new Crystal.

2* Here, let me hold onto that for you. Ha ha ha!

* You have collected 2 Shadow Crystals.

1* But don't let down your guard. I feel your next opponent may be... hm.

3* In reality, it may be impossible to win.

0* ... Unless you use the power of the Shadow Mantle.

0* Here, it may look like an old scrap of cloth, but...

1* ... eh?

3* I can't find it. Did someone... take it...?

2* Hahaha! Well now, there goes your one chance of victory!

* You have collected 2 Shadow Crystals.

3* Unfortunately, without the Shadow Mantle, at 2 you may remain.

0* Fate is approaching... and it is not on your side.

1* ... What is that? It appears you have a Shadow Crystal.

3* ...

0* Unfortunately, I believe that you are missing one from your previous adventures.

0* ...

3* But, are you sure? Are you sure you didn't defeat that clown...?

0* Perhaps... You just haven't remembered that you had yet.

2* That's right, as long as you ever defeated that enemy in the past...

2* Then perhaps, even now, that Crystal might turn up somewhere close... Perhaps!~1

2* Aha! Another Shadow Crystal! You found it...

0* You can't see it, so perhaps you didn't notice...

0* Didn't you defeat him? Didn't you defeat Jevil?

2* Here, I'll take that Crystal. Now, you have collected 2 of them! Huzzah!

* There are many fresh faces in town, I see.

2* It warms this old fluff to see such hope.

3* I was even surprised to see the Queen again.

0* Same as ever... Well, aren't we all.

* Those young men have made an interesting shop.

3* They're leaving the bagel business, so I have the rest of their remaining stock.

* Those three young musical men are thinking about setting up a shop here.

2* I'm sure you'd appreciate having an option other than me, ha ha.

3* ... By the by, it's growing late, isn't it?

0* You should hurry home once you finish your business here.

3* You don't want to get caught when the sun goes down...

0* Kris, as your Prince and authority, I order you to...!

8* Please let me know what to do!

* Oh, thank you, Kris!
* I will!

Really!?

* Er, Kris, you know you can hold [~1] to run...?

* And yet you choose not to...?

6* Right, who knows how long these leisurely days will last...

0* There's nothing wrong with taking your time, Kris.

* You'll move faster by holding [~1]!

1* Or you're tired of what's being said.

6* ... No need to skip my text, right, Kris?


Yes


Don't

3* Oh, Kris!
* It's the training dummy I made!

0* OK!

3* Right, you already fought Lancer, didn't you...?

1* I was so excited to teach you, I absolutely blanked!

* Kris, once we pass through this door...

* Our adventure will really begin.

* A journey foretold exactly by the prophecy...

6* But, Kris, I believe YOUR choices are important, too.

0* This world is full of all kinds of people, Kris.

6* In the end, how we treat them makes all the difference.

8* So let's try our best to get by without FIGHTing.

1* If we can manage to do that...

0* I believe this tale may have a happy ending.

6* Otherwise, I fear that...

1* ... you may not... find the result favorable.

3* ... Oh, I'm sorry! Is that too much to ask?

0* Kris, I knew you were a hero the moment I saw you.

8* Let's try our best, alright?

3* O-oh, I'm sorry!

6* Kris, in the end, what you choose is up to you.

3* Wow. You three's collective dad must be very cool.

7* Hahahaha!!!

0* Okay, okay, seriously, you wanna chat or something?

0* Smart, kind, sweet... couldn't ask for a better daughter.

5* I just wish she wasn't so... defenseless.

1* Scary movies, bugs, Santa Claus... everything scares her.

5* And when it happens, she freezes like a deer in headlights.

0* Remember she used to even be afraid of humans under the bed?

7* (Kris, it was NOT nice of you to hide under there, by the way!)

1* ... anyhow, that's what's tough about being in here, Kris.

4* Not what's going on with me.

5* Just that... in the meantime, I can't be there to protect her.

3* Keep an eye out for her, OK?

3* Kris, even if we've grown apart, we still love your family.

4* After all, me and Asgore were college pals, right?

1* Oh hey... now that Asriel's off to college...

2* Y'think he's doing any CRAZY parties, like me and your dad?

3* Heh, I'm just pulling your leg. Your dad was no party animal.

7* Your MOTHER on the other hand...! Whoo!

4* She'd alway fuss about going, but once the party started...

7* Yikes, man!

7* Once she hit me clear across the room with a key lime pie!

2* I got smashed into the snack table and toppled everything!

7* Tasty pie though. Couldn't complain.

1* ... So, why am I in here...?

4* Well, they found some crap, so it's just some tests.

3* Yeah, it's no big deal. Nothing a Holiday can't handle.

4* I'll be outta here in a jiff, then I can go back to, I dunno...

* With a darker storyline and more mature themes...

* The second one treats the viewer like a real adult...

* Instead of like an animal that will die if it goes ten seconds without seeing a beach ball.

* Not to mention, Mew Mew's character in the first one...

* Is more stale than the ramen I eat at home by myself with the lights off.

* Cast some SPELLS when it's filled up far.

* TP...! It's quite a caper!
* TP! Stands for...
* ... Toilet Paper!

* ... no, it stands for Tension Points.

1* What, really!?

* TP only lasts, inside a fight.
* Once you win, it's out of sight.

* Having extra, feels unbearable.
* No point in saving, it's straight-up terrible.

* But leftover TP turns into extra money at the end of battle...

1* You mean I only should have been using one square!?

* You get TP when you DEFEND.
* Protect yourself, then cast SPELLs, friend.

* You also get TP by getting close to bullets.

* Look for the heart outline when you get close to bullets.

* What? It safely removes a "TIRED" enemy from combat.

1* What if you're fighting a BABY!?

* Ralsei has a spell that HEALS, dude.

* Why use that, when you can eat FOOD?

* Because you won't have to use up an ITEM?

1* I could have avoided all those empty calories!?

* So there's no reason to use it.

1* Unless...
* Unless you wanted not to hurt -

* SO THERE'S NO REASON.

* Susie's gone, I'm afraid, I'm afreet.

*Seems like WARNING is obsolete.

* The days of WARNing, have long since past.

* The circumstances, changed pretty fast.

* Susie always attacks, the foe on top.

* She'll smash them, with a crushing chop.

* She always strikes, at the first thing she sees...

* ...

1* Oh no, oh no!
* She's looking at ME!

* Susie's gone, so no attack.

* Will you two pick up the slack?

* Susie's BUSTER, RUDE as may be...

* Will deal more damage, if you just press [~1]!

* Susie loves, when you give us MONEY.
* She will -

* Nope, don't care.

1* Did I say something funny!?

* Susie's gone, so no facts.

* Will you two pick up the slackts?

* When HP goes negative, your friends fall down

* But bringing them back, is easy-town

* Plain foods and spells, work like a charm -

* And with a MINT, you can cure all HARM.

* Even normal items and spells can revive people, huh?

* Yeah, that's what I'm saying!

* If you only ACT, you might start to think -

* What about the guy with the scarf in pink?

* If you know ACTing will make the enemy friendly -

* Then you can ask me to SPARE on the SAME TURN.

* Or, cast PACIFY if you know they'll get TIRED.

* If you plan ahead, a lot can happen in ONE TURN!

1* Hey, who's the MASTER here, me or you!?

* It's a good idea, to give us BUCKs.

* It'll make you happy, and fill you with LUCKs.

0* So we bought that headband with the little red horns on it.

4* Oh, you wore it for months! Whatever happened to it?

2* Kris, I need to grade these assignments.

0* Perhaps you should go to bed...?

* O... Oh, Kris...

4* D... Did you want to talk about something?

* Huh?

3* O-Oh, these flowers...? They're from your dad...

0* He... He always asks how you're doing in school...

7* ... Then gives me a bouquet of them.

1* ... A-actually, that he always gives me flowers...

4* ... R-really makes me w-wonder if he... If he l-likes...

B* I-if... If he l-likes...

A* ... The awesome comics I lent to him.

B* Honestly, HE kind of reminds me of a superhero, Kris.

A* (He's huge and could kick my ass.)

0* Oh, this saucer of milk?

7* I-It's for my kitty, MewMew! She's a perfect angel!

3* ... uh? What does she look like...?

9* W... well, I've never actually s-seen her, b-but...

7* Ever since I started putting out milk, it's been disappearing.

6* S... So I'd like to think that there's a cat.

9* M... My cat.

0* K... Kris, even though you never got the chalk...

0* You deserve an award for trying so hard to find it.

3* So, in return, I can let you borrow, um...

0* M... My home-made DVD collection of the Symptons!

7* Y-you know, the sitcom about the middle-class monster family.

3* It's got every episode in all 28 seasons!

0* It's the funniest, most quotable show ever...!

3* But make sure you don't watch past the second season 

9* Since they just rebooted it as Symptons Turbo 

8* They all started driving their own motor-vehicles 

3* And fighting giant giga-demons and stuff 

9* The main problem about that is that it kind of 

6* Lost the focus on family that it had earlier 

7* When their vehicles were shaped like animals 

5* And they were friends with the animal vehicles too 

3* And let's not get into Symptons Galaxy Force 

8* Where the Symptons discover another Earth 

9* On the other side of the Sun 

6* WOULDN'T THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD JUST 

1* ... Huh?

2* ... You don't want to watch it?

B* ... Th-That's ok, Kris...

7* Kris... I'm SO sorry you have to go through this.

4* In fact, I wonder if... d-do you think...?

* A brave man, brilliant, and sharp.

* Kris, it is a shame you were not able to have him as a teacher.

* And, difficult for Ms. Alphys, as his replacement.

* Let us pray that the Angel will smile upon her.

* As per the ritual, a hammer is buried in the earth here.

* To symbolize his existence.

* To connect his spirit to the divine.

* Originally a smith by trade, he began writing history...

* And made a turn into telling stories,

* As a means to entertain his children.

* That such a story, created for such a simple purpose,

* Could blossom into such a large, wonderful, world-changing thing...

* That is the majesty of words, Kris.

* ...

* My father was blessed to have such a talent for writing.

* Ah, Kris. Your brother. He is a very kind young man.

* Perhaps even a little... overzealous, in his younger days.

* He would visit me often to confess... to various, "sins".

* Despite the absence of sin, or confession, in our religion.

* I remember his small face, sobbing, as he admitted he had,

* "Dropped the lizard in the pit to jump high."

* Nearly omitting the fact that he had done so in a "videos game."

* He also confessed to various "sins" on your behalf,

* Begging for your forgiveness for "dropping the lizard on purpose."

* I would always "forgive" him and send him home.

Nowhere? Mumble... No, no... This is somewhere...

Mumble, this old tome admires your... inquisitiveness.

Mumble... You're very interested in going nowhere, aren't you?

Mumble... well, I have a ticket there. Yes, I have a ticket there...

Mumble, mumble... A ticket to nowhere...

Mumble, mumble... But, the ticket is somewhere...

Mumble, mumble... Yes, it was left here. It was left here by...

Mumble, oh, I don't seem to remember...

Mumble... mumble... You are alone, are you?

Good, it's not a good idea to go nowhere with somebody else...

Mumble, mumble... alone is better...

I only have one ticket after all... Where is it...

Mumble, mumble... That's right, it's in the wardrobe!

Mumble... That's odd... I thought it was in the wardrobe...

YOU LOOKED IN THE WARDROBE.

ALAS, THE WARDROBE WAS EMPTY!

Mumble, mumble... Mumble, mumble...

Mumble, mumble... What? You can't find the ticket?

Odd, quite odd... Considering...

Back when I was just a little old TV.

Everyone used to gather around my glow to watch the specials,

Smiling. Laughing. Eating butterscotch pie.

Wasn't that just so much... fun?

To watch me.

I... was so happy.

Then...

People stopped coming.

Everyone disappeared... one by one...

No one wanted to watch TV anymore.

No one wanted to play games anymore.

I've been all alone...

Until now.

When the KNIGHT appeared...

The ROARING KNIGHT.

And I was told that if I keep you three busy,

I can have ALL the people watch me that I want.

L* Oh, okay. That actually makes sense.

* Now, are you ready or what!?

* Here are the instructions for the [IMG]0.

* FOOD is FALLING! KRIS, CATCH the food on your head to STACK IT UP!

* THROW it to customers with ~1! If the food touches them, they'll gobble it up!

* SPECIAL CUSTOMERS will sometimes appear! They're worth [IMG]1 POINTs, don't miss 'em!

* SUSIE will probably cook BURNING FIRE. JUMP over it with ~1!

* Missed food will also turn into BURNING FIRE, so be careful!

* Big stack, [IMG]1 POINTs! But... You'll MOVE and JUMP slower! Be careful!

* Last until the end to [IMG]2 But if the POPULARITY GAUGE runs out, it's GAME OVER!

* Now don't touch that dial, OR that fire!

* Because...

* THAT's what I like to hear!

* Now get those pans over easy, or these eggs are gonna be TOUGH!

* When the NOTES hit the MARK, press with good timing to PLAY them!

* ~1 (or ~2) will play notes on the LEFT!

* ~1 (or ~2) will play notes on the RIGHT!

* Make sure to HOLD the button for those LONG NOTES!

* Got it, Kris?! Good! That's all you gotta know!

* SUSIE and RALSEI will be doing their own things, so IGNORE THEIR PARTS.

* That being said, MUSIC is a TEAM SPORT! If ANY of you play bad...

* The POPU & LARITY LIGHTS will darken! And if they go black...

1* ...

2* Guess who, idiots.

0* ... at least call me SusieZILLA.

Y* That's SusieZILLA, chump.

H* Aww! Susie, your costume is so adora... umm, scary.

Q* Heh, obviously.

K* Uhh... so I do what. Kick your ass?

* No. Uhh, no. [IMG]2 had a change in her TV-loving heart.

* She may wreck the city, but she'll protect me, TV statue, with her life.

* For if the bad guys take me down... There's no more TV!!!

K* ... Whatever. Let's just make the most of this, Kris.

* Now, the rules are simple!

* Haters of true entertainment are constantly trying to kill me!

* Defeat them before they hit me and ruin my pristine sheen!

* Susie's ok to get hit, but if I run out of "Popularity", it's game over!

* Kris and Ralsei control Susie via rope like an unwanted puppet.

* Spin the rope with ~1 to smash anything and everything.

* That's it! You'll learn the rest on the job... Or else!

* Now, all READY!? Tail on tight!? Taken your radioactive breath mints!?

7* Hey, Ralsei!

9* You're not gonna BELIEVE what I did after our adventure yesterday!

2* After we saved the WORLD, I went over Kris's...

9* Almost baked an ENTIRE pie...

2* And then marathoned movies ALL NIGHT!

H* Aww, Susie! It sounds like you had a wonderful time!

Q* Yeah, it wasn't AWFUL, I guess...

2* I want to hear all about it...

Q* Um, let's just get going, first!

6* Oh, uh, yeah!

N* Heh, yeah, I mean, it was...

S* The Festival's kinda stupid, y'know? I mean, Obviously.

D* Just... uh...

N* I mean, we don't even have to play any games.

2* We could... just make a mess. Cause some trouble.

D* Just...

N* I dunno, could be... fun if you...

T* ... just went, you know?

Q* No, Susie... I...

7* I... want to, I just...

8* I can't go.

R* ...

S* ... um, did I say something weird?

Q* No! No, not at all, Susie!

e* I'm happy to be invited by you, Susie, I am...

b* It's just...

c* I'm a Darkner.

b* I can't go to the Light World.

8* Even if I... wanted to.

R* Uhh... why?

e* Because I... Because we...

8* ...

a* Susie, it's... hard for me to explain this, but...


==============
obj_ch3_PGS01D
==============

You see, Susie. You and Kris
live in the "Light World."

A place where everything is as you see.

That is... as long as there's light.

You see, when it gets dark...

Things become more indistinct.

A chair can look like a monster.

A poster can look like it's moving.

Your eyes can't see the truth anymore.

And when the light runs out...

You see nothing.

Of course, your mind can't make anything of nothing.

But what if?

What if it became even darker?

Darker than dark.

What if we could take away
the light that wasn't there

Until we reached another side?

If that were to happen...

You could start to see things again.

And hear them.

And feel them.


========================

The Dark Fountains change everything into a fantasy.


====================
obj_ch3_PGS01E_field

That is the Dark World, Susie.

An alternate view of reality through the lens of shadow.

In other words...


======================
obj_ch3_PGS01E_hallway
======================

In the Light World, in reality...

Lancer is just an average playing card.

Queen... is just a laptop.

In other words... when the lights come back on...

This world is no longer "real".

The places you go, the people you meet... none of them are.

Even I, the one telling you this... I too, am...


==============

U* But Ralsei, how can you say you're not real!?

D* I can see you... I can feel you... I can hear you...

U* "Normal objects" don't have... feelings and stuff!

8* That's right, Susie.

a* They... shouldn't.

c* That's why... I don't want you and Kris...

e* ... to worry too much about us, OK?

a* It's funny, I was... overjoyed to make friends.

e* Then, selfishly, I... started feeling sad, too.

B* Sad I couldn't be your friend in real life, Susie.

B* That I CAN'T do your homework. That I can't go with you.

e* That I... can't be there to help you when you really need me.

R* Ralsei...

8* I'm sorry. That's why I... If, you know, me, Lancer...

c* We can't do it all. So... if you ever feel like we're not enough...

e* Just forget about us and make some real friends, okay?

V* ... Ralsei... you...

J* You idiot! How can you SAY that?!

b* You think I could just FORGET you!?

I* Forget Lancer!? Forget everyone!?

c* I don't care what you say you are...

d* You're real to me, OK!?

b* ...

8* Susie, I...

a* I'm happy to hear that, but...

b* SHUT UP and listen to me!

I* No matter what you say...

b* No matter what you are...

c* Me... you... Kris... We're a TEAM, alright?

d* None of us are gonna forget each other!

b* So please...

c* Just...

d* ... just...

* I... I just wanted to be watched...

* I just wanted you to look at me...

* One last time..

* ...

* Since... since a little while ago...

* All that I've been broadcasting, is the same reruns, over and over...

* I... I don't have anything anyone wants to watch anymore...

* I'm irrelevant... I'm junk...

* I don't wanna be thrown away...

8* Mr. Tenna... I... understand how you feel.

Q* To want to be... important. To be... useful.

5* Perhaps... you might not be watched much anymore...

Q* But... that doesn't make you a failure, Tenna!

0* You've brought smiles, light into Lightner's lives...

2* ... to Kris's family and friends, for so long.

0* So, there's nothing to be ashamed of.

Q* If... that ever comes to an end.

e* Darkners... all become obsolete eventually.

a* But we aren't "real", Tenna.

e* We shouldn't make Lightners worry about what happens to us.

b* It'd just... make them unhappy, wouldn't it?

* ...

* ... m... maybe... you're right...

* B... but... I...

V* Hey.

W* You wanna know what I think?

8* Susie?

V* I think...

2* You don't have to take being thrown away.

V* Lemme tell you.

V* I've never really been able to... make friends.

V* I was always... the scary girl. The bad kid.

V* The only times anyone ever got close to me,

V* ... were as a joke.

V* And even if I did start to make a real friend...

V* ... I'd always end up...

V* Moving away.

V* When I moved here, I thought it would be the same thing.

V* I felt like you.

V* I felt like a broken toy no one wanted.

V* ...

V* Kris's mom saw me. Toriel.

V* Saw me sitting on the bench in the graveyard, crying.

V* She asked me what was wrong, and...

V* Told me everything was going to be okay.

V* Took me to the diner. Bought me a hot chocolate.

V* Talked to me. Told me I'd make friends.

V* That... gave me hope. Even just a little.

V* ...

V* And recently. That hope's been growing.

L* Because... now I have friends.

2* Real friends.

9* Friends I wanna keep.

2* Kris. Ralsei. Lancer... Toriel, too.

R* Even though I thought I was broken...

S* I just needed to find the right people, y'know?

D* So...

S* Don't worry, dude.

T* Someone out there wants you. Promise.

2* Kris, you'll help me ask around town, right?

9* Someone's gotta want a TV.

* You... you'll help me!?

* SUSIE!!! You...

* You're INCREDIBLE! You're AMAZING!! No... you're MARVELOUS!!

* We're inventing a [IMG]0 just for you!!!

D* But... you gotta give back Toriel.

T* She's got people that need her, too.

* I...

* I understand!

* I know it's not what the KNIGHT wants, but...

* Kris!! Susie!! Good contestants deserve a good prize!!

* This way!!

I* Susie...

2* Hear that, Ralsei?

Q* No one's gonna get thrown away.

L* Not you. Not me. Not Kris.

Q* S-sorry! We can get going now.

* Oh, Lanino? Well...

* My SUNSHINE IS GONE!!! My brilliant SUNSHINE!!!

* Everything reminds me of him! Everything!

* The nighttime... the DAYTIME... I saw a big wheel of cheese and...

* I THOUGHT IT WAS HIS FACE!!!

* That's... that's right! I'm the wave, aren't I!? I can weather any storm MYSELF!

* We'll see how far he gets without me to do his MAKEUP!

* Thanks, Kris! You're a real cucumber, you know? Umm, not a cool one, but...

* That's... that's right! Weather girls are the wave... aren't they!?

* A cool cloud never stays alone in the sky for long! Heheh!

* Thanks, Kris! You're a real cucumber, you know? Umm, not a cool one, but...

L* Took you long enough.

P* Susie! Susie, look! I made it to Level 2!

A* Level 2, huh?

2* Kris, you're the tryhard. Whaddya you think?

7* Heh, you should have seen it, Kris!

9* He was actually RAGING at the falling arrow part.

X* I suppose I was, not very chuffed, by that dart.

1* But I... I had fun.

K* ... s-sorry! Did you want to play, Kris?

6* Dude, we need to seal the fountain.

0* (Tenna looks busy...)

* TV-tastic!!! Then let's rock and roll, folks!!!

2* Hey! There's Tenna onstage over there...!

A* ... maybe we could talk to him for a sec?

2* Y'know, get some hints about the next board...?

9* Anyway, let's go!

A* W-wait.

0* Kris, maybe we should let Susie go...

2* Then, let's close our eyes and think about what she's doing now...

K* Sure! We can chill! With our, um, eyes open.

L* Huh? I'm not quite sure what you...

K* W-well, I...

d* Kris, I'm sorry, but...

Q* This is... my face.

e* And if there's one thing I like about myself, it's this...

a* So, even if you think it's boring, or too similar to...

K* D-don't laugh, Kris. If you think it's the same as...

Q* OK, I get it! You don't think it's too similar! But...

U* Kris!

1* H-huh? thanks! I...

K* (Wait, is that a compliment...?)

Q* I know, um... I look like a monster, but...

a* At the end of the day, I'm not... a Lightner.

Q* I'm just a shadow. Like everything else.

2* So it's up to you... How you think of me.

D* H-huh? Thanks! I...

1* Well, I couldn't be more happy hearing something like that...

2* That means both you AND Susie think I'm cute.

D* S-sorry! I'm being proud.

2* (I shouldn't let this put me in such a good mood...)

K* ... uh, okay. Weirdos.

N* You know, I thought he was a weirdo at first, but...

2* Tenna's not such a bad guy, y'know, Kris...? Just kinda lonely.

9* (Right? I knew you were actually having fun, too.)

K* (Oh, okay, that's what he was talking about.)

1* ...

D* ... man.

4* There's nothing that pisses me off more...

D* ... than people who don't tell you the whole deal.

Q* ... You mean, Tenna...?

4* Yeah. I dunno what, but... he's hiding something.

D* ... Let's go take a look around, Kris.

d* (... We haven't really been able to... discuss much for a while.)

K* (Umm, okay...!)

0* ... what?

1* You wanna say something?

K* "Ask Susie how she's doing?"

D* ... uh, good, I guess.

K* (Honestly? Playing with Ralsei and you has been great. Just...)

D* (We kinda... skipped over the whole, Dark World's not real thing.)

T* (I mean, I kind of knew it... couldn't be, you know.)

S* (Like, going on adventures, making friends...)

T* (It... it already all sounds like a dream.)

S* (So the fact that it kind of is...)

9* Hahahaha!

2* The stupid, creepy way you said that... pretty good.

2* The stupid, fake-heroic way you said that... pretty good.

9* Arright, Kris. If Ralsei can't come to the Light World...

Y* Then YOU'RE gonna wear doggy ears and do my homework.

9* ... stop howling! Man, you're such a pain in the ass. Heh.

Y* Haha, like you're one to talk, idiot!

W* You got so few friends...

X* Your mom was even happy you, heh...

S* ... uh, made friends with me, I guess.

R* ...

S* ... man, we could've been friends way before.

9* Isn't that stupid...?

S* ... But yeah, maybe it's not real. The dark world.

N* (I just wish Ralsei would realize...)

D* (That doesn't matter to me so much.)

D* Huh? How I'm doing? Umm...

2* Those games were a lot of fun, weren't they?

J* I've never played such a game before... I kind of...

Q* I kind of got so wrapped up...

H* Haha! Kris, you're always so kind...

e* E-Exactly! I knew I got a little too carried away!

d* ... um... Anyway, those games were fun, but...

a* ... I'm not sure they could replace the festival...

d* ...

Q* Kris, can... I ask something selfish?

2* On the day of the festival...

J* Perhaps... if you could purchase some ice cream or something...

D* O-Of course, Kris! I mean, it'd be your money!

a* And it's not like... I would've contributed anything, anyway.

Q* I realized, you know...

a* Being friends is... a responsibility.

P* Thank you, Kris!

Q* I realized... being friends is... a responsibility.

a* A responsibility... I can't... fully complete.

Q* The cakes I bake, the cotton candy we eat, it might be yummy.

a* ... But, when you return to the Light World, you won't be full.

Q* Kris, at least as long as you're there...

B* I can know she won't be lonely, or hungry.

2* ... Thank you, Kris.

C* N... Noelle?

Q* Kris, I...

e* I think that's...

8* ...

b* A bad choice.

U* I mean, I'm sorry! A bad choice to, make alone.

Q* Noelle, might want to go with Susie...

e* I hope you can... figure out a nice solution!

L* Noelle...?

K* Umm, I'm sure if Susie was with you, too...

J* Noelle would probably really appreciate it!

G* I'm sure the three of you would have a lot of fun!

Q* Umm, if it's... the three of you.

D* K-Kris! Y-You know I can't go...

1* Umm, maybe I should ask Susie to get YOU an ice cream?

2* And, um... ride the ferris wheel with you for me...?

N* W-wait! Just... Make sure Susie has a good time!

a* Make sure she's not lonely... is all I'm asking.

L* ...

K* Berdly?

M* ...

J* Umm, you don't have to repeat yourself so loudly, Kris.

U* I - you don't have to repeat yourself, Kris.

Q* If, it's what you really want, Kris!

K* I'm sure Susie would be happy to see you, um, spread your wings...

d* You mean... maybe...

K* You and Susie could just go to the Castle Town together?

J* And spend time with... all of us instead...?

1* Kris... That would be really sweet.

Q* (Umm, I hope that's what you meant...)

J* Susie...?

W* Umm, nothin'. Nevermind.

O* ...

6* ... Old man?

D* Shouldn't you be busy... writing a letter or something?

* ... Shouldn't you be helping that pumpkin fella?

D* Nah, Ralsei's got it covered. I... I quit.

* Quit? Quit what?

D* You know. Healing. That green sparkle thing.

* Hmm. So you don't like doing it?

D* Well, uh... I dunno, actually.

N* At first, I was really... I was really excited I could do it.

D* But like... I sort of realized...

T* I just suck at it. Heh.

* What if you practiced? Put a little shell into it.

D* I mean, I kind of... When people aren't looking...

N* I was kind of trying to practice a little, but...

D* I sorta realized, y'know?

T* I'll never be as good as Ralsei, so what's the point?

R* So everyone can see how... bad I am?

D* I should just stick to what I'm good for.

T* Y'know... uh... hurting people... magic.

* Hm. Is that so.

* Didn't take you for a purple bellied coward.

Z* Coward...? Hey, what do you mean by that!?

H* Look, just CASTING it isn't a big deal!

* Alrighty then...

* Here.

C* What?

P* Susie, that was a great idea!

6* H-huh?

Q* I was wondering why my healing wasn't working...

K* I suppose... I was only healing the outside.

J* But Susie, your healing blast seemed to hit the spot!

6* Huh?

K* Well, heh, I was uh, actually just trying to heal that old man...

K* ... Old... man?

A* Yeah, he's...

Q* H-huh? But, you know, Susie might want to be...

K* It, it might be nice if she had this chance to...

4* ...

Q* Perhaps if you just closed them for a moment?

Q* ...

2* Cool, let's hear what you got.

* (You explained the situation to Susie.)

0* So the only two leads we got are...

1* Undyne... and the mayor, huh.

D* ... I guess if we think about the 3 symbols on the shelter...

0* ... That pretty much tracks.

0* One looked like the church symbol.

1* Don't got that code yet, but it could be here.

B* One looked like the badge the cops wear.

D* ... So Undyne probably knew something, too.

0* One looked like a pine tree, and the mayor...

K* Likes trees, right? I mean, there's one in City Hall.

0* ...

1* Maybe... Maybe that's why the Knight captured Undyne?

0* They wanted to take their code so they could get in...

B* ... But in that case...

C* They'd have to know the other two codes, too.

0* Someone who goes to church... who knows the mayor...

K* Who also has something to do with the cops?

C* ... Who the hell could that be?

0* ...

D* ... Guess... City Hall's our best bet for now.

6* ... what? Noelle said... her mom keeps everything important at home?

0* ... Yeah... wait, now that I think about it...

1* The mayor's Noelle's mom, right?

C* Maybe if we tried...

2* Kris...? Umm, and... Susie...?

3* Would... would you want to come by my house...

6* ... and... work on our projects after church?

7* H... huh? Uhh, yeah! Of course!

4* Great!

0* I'll, um, go bring my dad back to the hospital.

9* Cool. That's, uh, awesome! See ya later.

2* Too easy, right? Boom! Gimme five!

K* ... uhh, what's up?

C* ... you, uh, got somethin' against Noelle, Kris?

1* ...

0* Like, uh, hey, maybe things took a weird route right now...

D* I mean, who'd expect she'd ask us like that?

2* But we should be glad it's going so fast, right?

D* ... right?

0* ...

9* Hey, how 'bout some of the red stuff? ... no?

A* Heh, your loss. Know you're gonna want it later.

0* ... let's just go already.

0* Her mom's the mayor, right?

1* And the front of their house... it's got pine trees all over.

K* Kinda like the holidays just got frozen in place.

A* Maybe if we can sneak in there ourselves...

2* We might be able to find a clue in there?

9* ... I got an idea.

A* Hey, nice singing.

E* Susie!? How d-did you... wh-why are you...

M* Umm, what brings you to, um, church, Susie?

2* Right?

A* It looks like blood.

M* Definitely! Haha! That's why I'm! Always drinking it??????????

Q* Yeah. Too bad they just ran out.

0* Are you worried about her...? Undyne?

5* Me? A cop like her? Hell no!

D* Y'know... It's, just that...

Q* Don't worry, Susie. Someone strong like her will be OK.

I* I want this place to be a place...

0* Where you can forget about the real world for a while.

2* Just relax, OK...?

E* And if anything tough happens,

J* I'll come help you two, as fast as I can!

D* ... thanks, Ralsei.

* Of course you didn't. There's nothing to miss.

* Those who can't speak the truth are liars.

Did you ever hear
that old tale?

Yes, the old tale,
based upon the
prophecy...

Lord of the Hammer.

Think I heard about it.
What happens?

Chapter 1
The March of
the Dark King.

The heroes defeat
the king and
stop the dragon.

Chapter 2
The City of 
the Shining.

The heroes do
battle in chariots
to save the Queen.

Chapter 3, The 
Isles of 
Northernlight.

The heroes travel
among the islands
and catch a glimpse
of a lost land.

Chapter 4, The
Trials of the 
Holy Hammer.

A great smith gives
the heroes a
terrible weapon.

Chapter 5, The 
Field of Pink 
and Gold.

The vast garden is
charred in an inferno
of jealousy.

...What happens next?

Geheheh! Who knows?

There was only one more
chapter... After that,

It all stopped.

That next book, it
never did get written.

The story, it became so 
grand, so overwhelming,

Some say it swallowed up
the author himself.

The ones who could write
the next, the youth,
the pen was lying
there for them to
pick up.

To make the next page.

...they never did.

But you, my dear?
I see a story lit
up in your eyes...

Burnin' bright...
Burnin' black.
Burnin' up
everything.

The bell's ringin' now.
Seems we've reached
the final rounds.

So... how do you 
think it all ends?

No, how do you want
it to end?

An ending, huh...

...If I could choose… 
I guess...

I wouldn't have an 
ending!

It's just better if
stuff just...
goes on forever, right?

Gah ha ha ha
ha ha ha!!! Well
ain't that somethin'.

out their justice.

You choose eternity.

Miss, hold on
dearly to that thought.

For the tides of fate
are drawing close.

And soon, an ocean
of ink shall wash
across the pages.

But... there is one
thing that can
overwrite the dark.

A white pen,
known as hope.

Miss! I believe...
this is what you hold.

Me? Nah, Kris
has the pen.

My weapon's like a
hairbrush or something.

Geh-hahahahaha!
Is that so?
Is that SO???

Yep.
Now shut up
and give me
that axe!

Wh... what kind

was that!?

Sorry, thought you'd hit
it back! Geh heh heh!

Oh yeah!? I'll show
you!! Kris, let's use
it again!!

Hmm, dunno what
you just did,
but you should
probably keep
it up!

you're gonna
lose if ya
don't, gahah!

Whew, gaha! What a rush!
You're really pickin'
this stuff up fast!
Now it's my turn...!

Before, you said you
fancied yourself a
hero, didn't ya?
Hmmm... That's
real interesting.

Now, I don't know
much about "heroes"...
... But I know that
whatever ya call 'em,
there is someone.

Someone who'll never
give up trying to
do the right thing,
no matter what.

There's no prophecy
or legend 'bout anyone
like that.

It's just something
I know is true.

Nuzzle

???

Disgusting.

... What?
A battle?

I merely wanted to
investigate the water
container...

And suddenly,
you have drawn
me into a battle?

You are brash,
young soldier!
If you seek
my love...

You must prove
yourself worthy
of a princess.

Ah! What is this?
The chamber can
no longer hold me.

Oh, you brutes!
You scoundrels!

What? You treat me
like an egg, that
you should break me,

What have you done?
You have broken my
chamber!

Buble

B~1b~2e

Glory, glory.

Those who seek to
conquer hearts by
force shall find no
pure tincture,

But instead a bitter
poison, of gnashing
teeth and regret.

To reveal some hidden
beauty in gold and
softened ivory.

Nay, for love is
made of eggshells,

And should your love
be true, you would
already know what
lies inside.

Now I will seem as
all the others...

Oh, young soldiers,
how cruel you are,
that in your quest
to make me yours,

You would reduce
me to this terrible
state...

...
Goodbye...

It seems your affection
has caused some change
in my form...

Ah, it's breaking!

* You feel a strong presence from the watercooler.

* The watercooler babbles to itself sesquipedalianarily.

* The watercooler considers the precise gemstone to compare its own hue to.

* The watercooler stays its breath, too precious to waste... and keeps talking.

* The watercooler emits an aura of magnanimous condescension.

* Smells like water with holes in it.

* You hear the sound of raindrops.

* You hear a distant thunder.

* Waves crash far, far, far below.

* Smells like a rainstorm.

* HOLYWATERCOOLER - Just seems like a Watercooler with an ego.

* MISS MIZZLE - A Mizzle transformed with affection.

* You FLIRTED with HolyWatercooler!

Romantic are
your words...

* You begged for mercy...

* Everyone chatted around the Watercooler!

* (Seems like you should choose a topic...)

* (Everyone talked around the watercooler, explicitly about watercoolers!)

* You DAZZLEd MISS MIZZLE!

* Susie EMBEZZLED an item!

* But, there was nothing to steal!

* But, your items are full!

* But, she failed!

* Stole BitterTear!

* Ralsei NUZZLEd MISS MIZZLE!

* MISS MIZZLE got a little bit tired...!

* MISS MIZZLE became TIRED!

Too romantic! Have
you FLIRTED with
another WaterCooler?

Wipe your mouth
before you speak
with one as I,

For your phrases,
soggy with
experience,

Dribble like
shiny oil from
your lips.

Young soldier,
your words are
sweet like honeydew.
Is it the first
time you have
spoken to a lady
such as I?


First time

I flirt
with everyone

A young knight's
first love...

No wellspring
may be so pure.

I shall accept your
affection from afar,

And store it humbly
in a masonry jar.

On lonely eves, when
I hear naught
but the bubbling
of my heart,

I should open it and
listen once more,

To the tender whispers
of your kindness.

You think then, that
I shall drink the words

From those that would
flatter and cajole
and find them sweet?

Nay! You would do well
to save such tangy powders
for a man or woman
of the tap.

Young knight, your words
were accepted once before.

Already, they are
bottled up in a masonry jar,

Where, aged with time,
they will one day
be opened in a far season
To blossom
with the whisper
of old grapes.

Continue babbling, and
the chalice shall overflow
into turbulence,
and lose all meaning.

Blessed are those
who kneel to me,
for my waves shall
cleanse you.

Close your eyes,
for as long as you
adore my purity,
no harm shall
follow you.

* (HolyWatercooler took mercy on you!)

Again you pray!
With renewed vigor,

But now your hands
shake with
carbonated nerves

And fear
drips down your face
in painted horror.

You beg not
for salvation
by my purity, but

For fear of some
ugliness you see
reflected
in the glass.

Once again
I shall show mercy,
but no more.

* (HolyWatercooler took mercy on you!)

All around me
did you chatter,
but your tepid words

Have not once
been decantered
in my direction.
Your ignorance
bescorns me...

Speak well of my nature,
and you shall be spared.


Recruit


Beauty

Cactuses are better

Flowers

Ah, I see...
So you offer yourselves
to be my recruits.

Despite my stature,
I hardly hold a court here,

For, given respect even
by Lightners, I have all
I could desire.

But, should you behave
with quiet dedication,

There may be
some use for you yet.
Impress me!

Again you court me,
but your words float thin
on your intentions
puddle-shallow.

The estate of a fairy
cannot be shared
with mortals
whose tongues
are cracked and dry!

Remember me not
as a vainglory,

Though my face, shining
back both sun and moon
is brighter and more
holy than all stars,

And as such, my beauty
is more
of an objective science,
that cannot be denied.

Well said.

The Bluest Flower,
A disciple of my speech

Shy to no camera,
And a specimen of

Elegance and kindness.

Should you meet,
Please give my regards.

* (Noelle, no! She'll think you're a weirdo!)

* (... but...)

* Do you... hear something...? From the basement?

* Damn... hope it's not the severed hand...

* Faha, is that a Blood Crushers 2 reference?

* Huh? Dude, you actually know it?

* Of course! It's like a super-duper classic!

* One day, the protagonist wakes up without a hand...

* Then like, they hear music playing in the basement...

* And when they go down, it starts attacking them and stuff!!

* Cheezus, yeah! That was so freaky! Fahaha!

* Y'know, I never, like, saw the original. Only 2.

* Gosh, really? I have the box set, do you wanna watch?

* Dude, that would be awesome!

* Yeah! Gosh, I used to watch it, like, religiously, faha.

* It'd be nice to... have someone to watch it with again.

* Heheh.

* ... what about, uh, Catti? Doesn't she like scary stuff?

* Umm... well, she just... takes it a little serious?

* Like, analyzes all the magic and stuff. It's a little...

* Haha, that's wicked annoying.

* Umm, no, no! ... but... yes.

* OH, you want to know what else this reminds me of?

* So there's this guy that gets really mad about games...

* And he made this goofy horror series...

* ... about this bucket with ICE-E's face that tries to kill him?

* ... umm, have you seen that?

* ... no?

* Oh.

* Well, I think... maybe it's okay if you haven't.

* Dude, let's watch that too.

* Really? Haha, I have it saved on my phone, here.

* Hell yeah.

* Haha, this rules.

* I have like, a whole playlist. Haha.

* Auugh, Kris!

* We know it's you doing one of your stupid pranks!

* ... Let's go fix the breaker.

K* Oops. The tree...

9* Umm, sorry, Dad didn't clean the basement this year...

3* Anyways, the breaker's down here somewhere.

2* You know what REALLY made me afraid of basements?

8* Like... the underground levels from Dragon Blazers.

3* The music just repeats over and over again.

3* Hell yeah. That was weird.

F* You played it?

K* Yeah, uhh, only 2. As a kid.

1* Got it from the lost in found.

2* Even though it wasn't mine. Hahaha.

Q* Susie! Haha.

4* I played it secret-style so I wouldn't get in trouble.

J* Oh my gosh, same. I played 2 with my Dad, but like...

3* There was like... this Evil Route my parents didn't know about?

8* I always played it in secret so they wouldn't take it away.

K* Dude, I think I did that by accident.

R* Fahaha! You did the Evil Route by ACCIDENT?

3* Yeah, I like... I didn't know you could be... nice?

0* So I was just killing everything and getting, like, pissed.

K* Why the hell is everyone mad?

3* Pretty sure I'd... do it the good way, now, though.

B* Maybe.

O* Gosh, I'd love to see you play it for real.

1* Well, uh, if you got another copy...

A* Just leave it in the lost in found I guess.

Q* Faha, maybe I will!

K* So, uh, where the hell's the breaker?

L* Oh. That. Right.

O* I'm, um, looking for that.

B* Um, yeah, me too.

A* Dude, what if it wasn't Kris?

B* Huh?

2* What if it was a severed hand...

Q* Moving around down here...

L* ... and then suddenly it reached out and grabbed YOUR hand?

H* H-hey...

I* I would, um, die, I guess.

C* You'd just die?

H* I think if it touched me, I'd just be dead.

K* Like, before it even like, attacked?

O* No, I think I would just, um, die of shock.

8* Seems easier.

0* Well, uh.

A* Guess I would, uh, have to protect you.

L* What would, um, you do, Susie?

4* Thumb wrestling.

Q* Hahahaha!!

K* Okay, where the hell's the breaker, though.

8* Right? If we keep taking so long...

J* The severed hand is gonna touch us first.

E* Oh my gosh, this just brushed against my leg...

E* What the hell is that!?

H* It's... it's an... angel doll...

H* It... it was goddamn moving!

7* Was my coaster cool?

4* Umm, yeah? It had like, flames on it.

2* Heheh, yeah.

5* Honestly, the boy was... strange, though.

0* Huh? ... why?

4* He looked... He looked a little like Asriel?

9* You know, Kris's brother... but not.

0* Yeah, I mean he does kinda look like Kris's mom.

F* Huh?

K* From, uh, what you just said. He would.

3* Right. It just makes me wonder... why.

4* In the end I got so overwhelmed I... stopped questioning it.

*4 I ended up... I ended up being in a large city, with Kris.

*4 What was interesting is that... Kris just...

*3 Kris, just acted, not like their normal self?

*2 They acted... Just like they do recently, I guess.

*0 Huh. Kris seems normal recently to me.

*3 And everything was... I guess it was...

*1 Almost like a game or something.

*3 Encountering enemies, finding treasures, stuff like that.

*0 Huh. Never thought of it like that.

*3 And Kris, even though they kept looking at me...

*e Like they wanted to say something...

*9 Everything that came out of their mouth, sounded... odd.

*2 Like it was like on speaker or something.

*L Sounds like normal Kris to me.

*5 Well... It wasn't. Something was weird.

*2 I think Kris's just weird, period.

*0 Yeah, sometimes they mumble, sometimes they yell...

*C But sometimes, it's like... dude, I don't know why, but like...

*C For some reason they're really really...

*K Good at flirting?

*K ... h-huh? W... what makes you say that, Susie?

*C Uhhh, I mean, you're also invited?

*H (AM I THAT BAD???)

*D Yeah, but y'know, he can't go.

*C Cause of like, other school. Stuff.

*2 Huh.

*4 I mean, don't get any weird ideas or anything..

*D He just, doesn't really get included much. So...

*S What the heck? That's really sweet of you, Susie.

*0 So I noticed like, there's like...

*1 This photo of you and Kris? On the wall?

*8 Oh my Gosh, that's so old I forgot about it!

*C I didn't know you were like... umm... close, I guess.

*3 We... I mean, we...

*2 We're just neighbors so, I mean...

*3 We just... ended up seeing each other a lot. That's all.

*0 Okay, but like in the photo, you're like...

*1 Kinda like... riding a Ferris wheel together.

*8 Fahaha, yeah, it was kind of just... You know. Forced.

*D So, riding a Ferris wheel together, doesn't mean anything?

*8 Ummm, maybe not if it's like... Just like a forced thing?

*D Oh.

*T I mean yeah, obviously. I mean, it's just a stupid ride.

*2 ...

*M So if, theoretically, it was somebody else? It wouldn't...

*8 I MEAN,

*6 Maybe it's more about, how the two people in the wheel, feel?

*S So, maybe even if it is forced, then...

*2 Okay, cool. Haha.

*0 So how did you feel, back then?

*5 Well, Kris was quiet, and staring out the window...

*8 And suddenly out of nowhere, they shook the whole thing...

*4 And I screamed, and then they turned to me and smiled...

*0 ...

*1 So is that, good or bad?

*e ...

*3 Umm, I don't remember. I was a kid.

You're Mike


I'm Mike

* What!? What!? You think you're Mike or somethin'!?

* Wrong! WRONG!!! Are you GETTING this!?

* Ya hearing yourself YAPPING, ya room noise!? AIR CHECK!!

* ... Miii hi hi hi hi hi hyike!

* So ya figured it out, did ya?!

* Mee-yike, that's right!

* There's only ONE real MIKE...

* And that's ME!!!

* Sorry, sorry. I admit it. I admit it.

* It was so hard doing what Tenna wanted, I couldn't do it alone.

* I needed more...

* More Mikes!!! And along the way, I forgot who I really was.

* But you... Helped me remember.

* But you guys... Helped me remember.

* I'm the only Mike... The real one.

* These two guys...

* Are fakes!!! Beat them up!!!

* Make them pay for being so stupid!!!

* ...

* All right. I admit it. None of us are actually Mike.

* We're just kind of... in charge of Mike's room. Unofficially.

* Tenna's always talking to Mike, right...?

* Well, ya see, sometimes he wants to come to this room and... "visit" him.

* It's been that way since TV world!

* But he gets really moody if Mike isn't there... And takes it out on us.

* Now, here's the thing about that.

* Mike has NEVER been here!!! Not ONCE!!!

* And in order to stop Tenna from getting his nose twisted up...

* We just started taking turns pretending to be him!

* And you know what the weird thing is!? It actually worked!!!

* As long as there's a Mike, Tenna actually believes it!!

* Obviously, we couldn't let you in here, or you'd snitch.

* ... But it's too late now. Our conspiracy is busted.

* ... Just, before you tell Tenna, lemme ask you one last thing.

* Who's Mike?! Who is he?!

* 'cause none of us have ever seen him! None of us! Ever!

* Every time Tenna asks Mike to do something, it's either like...

* He just does it himself, we do it secretly, or...

* It just sorta happens!

* So who is Mike!? Who is he!? Is he just Tenna's imaginary friend!?

* Is he Tenna's alter-ego!? Like some alternate personality or something?!

* And why the hell does he get so much love and attention!?

* If the weather guys are second-in-command, what does that make him?!

* Uh, what if it's us?

* Us?

* Yeah, we been pretending to be Mike doin' stuff...

* What if when we pretend to be Mike, we's actually Mike?

* What?

* It's ALWAYS been us!?

* Then where'd the idea of Mike come from in the first place?

* Beats me...

* This doesn't make any sense!!

* What about you!? You came to this room...

* Are YOU Mike?! Are you!?

* What about you guys!? You came to this room...

* Are YOU guys Mike?! Are you!?

* Huh!? Are ya!? Are ya!?

* Ahhhh, I give up! As long as someone's Mike, it'll work out!

* Ahhhh, I give up! It's time to face the music.

* Go ahead... snitch to Tenna.

D* Tenna... he's... he's, uh, not in this Dark World, y'know.

0* Dude, we gave him away. He's not even in this Dark World anymore.

* H-huh!? You mean... We... We...

* We can keep pretendin's to be Mike as long as we's want!?

* We never WANTED to be Mike, you big bozo!

0* Now you've got three. Only two more, and we should have enough...

2* ... to make something I think you'll quite enjoy. Now good luck... and I'll be taking that Shadow Crystal.

0* It's strange. By all reasonable means, the strength of your next opponent...

1* Should be enough to already ring the bell on your defeat.

0* But, for some reason... I can't help but think you may win.

We have to...
figure out how to
get through to him...

Old man... what...
what are you doing?

the big idea!?

I wrote your letter

I...
I'm telling you... 

Kris... why... 
Why doesn't he
recognize me?

We can bring you
to our Castle Town!

If we bring you
there, you'll be...
You'll be all better!

And you...
don't have

If Ralsei shows up,

* The fear of dark, which appears in many forms.

* The atmosphere feels tense...
* (You can use UNLEASH!)

Get dunked on!!!

* ...

* Titan's DEFENSEs are dropped! ATTACKs will be super effective!

* The ground shudders.
